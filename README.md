# Data Science Portfolio
Collection of data science projects to accompany my learning!

## Data Analysis and Visualisations

[Exploratory Analysis: Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/titanic_exploratory.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the famouse Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Tools used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

[Data Visualisation: Marketing Dataset](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/artur.vilenskiy/viz/MarketingDataset-Part1CustomerSegmentation/Dashboard1): Created customer segmentation dashboard to better visualise different characteristics of the customers from marketing dataset from Kaggle. Tools used: Tableau Public.


## Machine Learning

### Classification

[Classification: Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/titanic_model.ipynb): A model to predict whether certain passengers of Titanic survived or not. Project includes data cleanup, feature engineering, data preprocessing, K-Fold cross validation to choose the best model, and hyperparameter optimization. Tools used: Pandas, Numpy, Pipeline, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib

[Classification: Bank Marketing](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/bank_marketing_logistic.ipynb): A model that predicts whether a customer would subscribe to a bank offering given some of its personal information. The projects include small EDA, data preprocessing, under sampling, ROC curve, and hyperparameter optimization. Tools used: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Imblearn, GridSearchCV, Logistic Regression. 

### Computer Vision

[Computer Vision: Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/Rock-Paper-Scissors%20Game): A program that uses camera feed to detect hand gestures(rock, paper, scissors) and calculate the score if two people are playing the game. Tools used: Cvzone, CV2, OpenCV, OOP.

[Computer Vision: Drag and Drop](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/drag_and_drop): A program that uses camera feed to detect hand movement and allows to move object around when pinched with a thumb and an index finger. Tools used: Cvzone, Mediapipe, CV2, OpenCV. 

### Association Rule Learning

[Association Rule Learning: Grocery Store](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/grocery_store_apriori.ipynb): Mini project to analyse large dataset of transactions in a store to find most common items that are frequently bought together. Tools used: Numpy, Pandas, Apyori.

### Natural Language Processing

[Natural Language Processing: Marvel's Rotten Tomatoes Reviews](https://github.com/arturvilenskiy/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/rotten_tomatoes_reviews.ipynb): Created a model that predicts whether a review is positive(fresh) or negative(rotten). Projects includes advanced web scraping, short EDA, bag-of-words model, classification model selection and implementation. Tools used: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Imblearn, Beautiful Soup, Selenium.
