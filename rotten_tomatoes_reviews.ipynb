    "For this project, I have decided to create a NLP model that would be able to differentiate between good and bad movie reviews. \n",

    "The reason behind this project was me watching a latest Marvel movie, which I have enjoyed, only to realise that it has pretty bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. So I have decided to get all the critics' reviews from 26 movies that are considered part of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU). An important note is that Rotten Tomatoes publishes only the summary rather than a full review. \n",

    "So this project consists of 3 major parts:\n",

    "1. Scraping Rotten Tomatoes to download all reviews for each of the 26 movies.\n",

    "2. Quick Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating Bag of Words model. \n",

    "4. Choosing the best classification model + hypertuning the parameters to (hopefully!) improve the performance."

    "Wow! While the accuracy seems to be around 70%, we can see that the model actually does not perform very well. While it generally performs well for fresh reviews, we can see that the precision for rotten reviews is too low. In other words, out of all reviews that were classified as rotten, only 31 percent of them were, in fact, rotten. It has quite good recall; however, the main explanation is that there are only 236 observation in the support, and since the model overclassifies many reviews for rotten, it is bound to get a lot of correct as well. \n",
