      "[Downey] gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story.\n",

      "Director Joe Johnston tries to inject some pulpy '40s-style fizz into the proceeding, but the film's lead footed pace never seems to lighten up.\n",
      "The best bit in this year's umpteenth comic book blockbuster, Captain America: The First Avenger, is when Tommy Lee Jones eats some steak.\n",
      "Captain America: The First Avenger feels like a clichéd blast from the past, lacking the spunk and grit that has made other comic book movies successful.\n",
      "A lifeless and clichéd action film that never lives up to its title or its title characters' ideals.\n",
      "It's difficult to dislike \"Captain America\" too much, because it's harmless and innocuous and, unlike almost every other tentpole summer movie, isn't secretly trying to give the audience a seizure.\n",
      "Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to go to war. It's 1942, and he's a scrawny kid from Brooklyn, too scrawny, according to army doctors, to join up.\n",
      "It serves its chief end to introduce the character, and Evans fills the role nicely. But as a stand-alone adventure, it's not captivating enough. I expect more from this genre.\n",
      "\"Looks great and hits all the right notes but never truly puts the pedal to the metal.\"\n",
      "Where are the iconic moments in these movies; the classic lines, the signature set pieces, the golden cues? Brand awareness is high but surely that wasn't the limit of the new studio's ambition?\n",
      "Altogether inferior to Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds.\n",
      "The final conflict is so protracted as to comfortably accommodate a bathroom break. Don't worry. You won't miss anything you haven't seen before.\n",
      "He's got the buff body, noble intentions and cool costume, but not much more. Captain America makes for a better propaganda symbol than superhero.\n",
      "Capitão América é apenas uma promessa de filme - e caberá a Os Vingadores fazer jus a esta promessa.\n",
      "Political correctness, flamethrowers and Wagner!\n",
      "Captain America paints a simple tale of goodies versus baddies with none of the depth, humor or class of Marvel's earlier X-Men summer offering.\n",
      "A few flashes of greatness appearing throughout, all but ruined by one of the worst 3D transfers of the year\n",
      "While not a terrible film, Captain America lacks edge necessary to excite viewers.\n",
      "Worst Superhero movie of the summer. Movie spends too much time showing a contempt for the character and is hampered by a script that gives too much away in the wrong places.\n",
      "If you get bored during this film (I certainly did, despite all the eye candy on screen) you can amuse yourself by deciding which of the characters has the worst German accent.\n",
      "When all these bland Marvel Comics franchise movies blur together in memory, it won't prove that they amounted to one great epic master narrative, but that they're all indistinguishable.\n",
      "Director Joe Johnston has fun with the myth of Captain America.\n",
      "Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely... whip up a Captain America story that often feels like its only purpose is to deliver Steve Rogers into the 21st century.\n",
      "What we don't have is a very compelling movie, or much of a leading man.\n",
      "On a scene-to-scene basis though, Captain America is lumpy and formless.\n",
      "A forced love angle and vapid dialogue dooms Captain America.\n",
      "[A] so-so experience.\n",
      "Lacks the zip and excitement of the other Avengers movies\n",
      "While not a terrible film, Captain America lacks the edge necessary to truly capture viewers' imagination.\n",
      "Saddled with a boring present-day prologue and an anti-climactic present-day epilogue that leaves the movie without an ending.\n",
      "It's symptomatic of the problem that the film spends more time figuring out how to set up a different franchise than how to make us care about this one.\n",
      "[The hero's] transformation from commonplace but with personality to bulky but generally nondescript echoes the movie's own shift.\n",
      "In a summer that seemingly has seen a new comic book adaptation every other week, it's a toss-up whether \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" or \"Green Lantern\" is the weakest of the bunch.\n",
      "While it never hits the craptastic depths of something like \"Green Lantern,\" most people are likely to come away from it thinking that it could have and should have been a lot better than it is.\n",
      "One of the biggest issues is that Captain America isn't all that super.\n",
      "Captain America's metabolism, Peggy tells him, burns energy four times faster than the average person's. The movie's metabolism burns out.\n",
      "Those who want to accentuate Captain America as a blueprint for how comic book movies should be made, must footnote such hyperbolic statements with an asterisk referring to the first half. Cause the second half puts a noose onto all its momentum.\n",
      "Here's what's missing: tension, drama, and most of all, a sense of wonder. This is a superhero movie, isn't it?\n",
      "As muscular, stiff, shiny, and dull as its star\n",
      "A tedious star-spangled World War II drama.\n",
      "Downside is the influence of modern technology, shining up a 1940's hero with glossy 2011 filmmaking tools, making the picture resemble more of a video game than an epic realization of jumbo comic book details.\n",
      "Tommy Lee Jones isn't distraction enough from the reality that we've been sold a $140 million trailer for a different movie. The egg's a little rotten.\n",
      "The picture is almost admirably boring, as if director Joe Johnston had wanted to distinguish his movie by not packing it with action, or even bothering much to define the characters.\n",
      "The homogenized, bland hero belongs in a Barbie Dream House, not a war. He's a cipher at the center of big-budget action that is cartoony, 3-D but never engaging.\n",
      "Evans - always a reliably dynamic and vivacious screen presence - can't do much to bring the character to life. As far as superheroes go, Cap remains a bit of a stiff.\n",
      "A capable, if somewhat unremarkable, affair, beset by the same origin-story shortcomings that plagued another U.S.-virtue-via-army-weaponry fable, Iron Man.\n",
      "The least inspired and engaging entry in the summer's superhero onslaught.\n",
      "The details in Captain America deliver, but the big moments fall flat - you can tell that we're intended to cheer here, to weep there, but the scenes that try hardest to elicit emotions just feel deflated.\n",
      "Red, white and bland.\n",
      "In terms of even recent films, Captain America lacks the deft touch, appealing character interaction and sophisticated storytelling skills of Marvel Comics' X-Men: First Class.\n",
      "Feels less like an exciting comic-book-hero movie than required reading for a course called The Avengers, arriving in theaters next summer.\n",
      "Captain America has a decent amount of heart and retro appeal, although neither can compensate for what is otherwise a rather ordinary comic book film.\n",
      "[A] hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D.\n",
      "The movie doesn't go far enough in any direction, grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly passé center.\n",
      "The direction is boring, the acting is boring, the writing is boring...this is pretty boring.\n",
      "Sometimes it stumbles upon the dullest components of a generic formula that is at the service of nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "After all, Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war, its hands are filthy with government propaganda.\n",
      "The movie's central premise asks: Who is this person? I'm not sure we get more than a superficial answer.\n",
      "The first half hour of Captain Marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because you're dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about, which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesn't know who she is.\n",
      "It's hard to remember Captain Marvel because it was boring.\n",
      "Women and fans of female heroes deserved better than Captain Marvel (a mediocre entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but there's no denying that it's rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe.\n",
      "The latest Marvel release is being positioned less as an actual film and more a wokeness bargaining chip for social media debate.\n",
      "A very expository script, that makes use of flashbacks, with a poor representation of a period, telling a story that is not exactly memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The backstory segments, which eat up the first third, are arduous, challenging your patience and viewer endurance.\n",
      "...just another generic, cookie-cutter comic-book movie that brings virtually nothing new to the table.\n",
      "Marvel gave a pretty mediocre answer to DC's Wonder Woman with this film but at least the cat was cool.\n",
      "There's no shortage of action scenes but they're heavy on special effects and light on emotional resonance.\n",
      "Where DC's \"Wonder Woman\" movie had intelligence and verve to spare, \"Captain Marvel\" slumps down comfortably into tired origin story clichés.\n",
      "Samuel L. Jackson provides 99 percent of the chuckles here, but then, he does that in just about any movie he's in. Why is this movie suddenly a financial blockbuster? The only blockbuster-ness it warrants is the one Captain Marvel crash-lands in.\n",
      "They really tried to cram it all in...boring, generic, by-the-book, which is unfortunate for Marvel's first female-lead movie.\n",
      "Lacking a unifying vision and a charismatic star performance, this film is less a big-screen comic than a patchwork quilt.\n",
      "Captain Marvel gives political cartoons a bad name.\n",
      "The film stands only as one more step to Endgame and nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "It's a film that aims to show-off its girl power, and does so with mixed results.\n",
      "Brie Larson seems oddly detached from the proceedings.\n",
      "Captain Marvel is an unremarkable, passable time killer...[Brie] Larson's performance is wooden...while the film's big action scenes are so lacking in imagination the screen often looks as though it's being continually doused in technicolour vomit.\n",
      "It was lacking, a bit flat, and I'm honestly concerned about how she will enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe...it's so concerned with being a feminist film that it forgets how to be a superhero movie.\n",
      "The screenplay would rather see Larson be stoic than human. She has a movie stars squint and a charisma that melts the screen, but the character, despite amiable virtue, isn't particularly relatable... there's nothing super about her.\n",
      "An almost impenetrable slog of pulp sci-fi notions of intergalactic wars and an amnesiac supersoldier, expressed without a modicum of camp or passion.\n",
      "Why praise a movie that panders (with a symbolic pat on the head) to the audience it is supposed to empower?\n",
      "The problem is with the corporate anticulture that controls these productions-and the fandom-targeted demagogy that they're made to fulfill-which responsible casting can't overcome alone.\n",
      "Marvel films should be allowed to be mediocre and confusing, but if you are invested in how Hollywood-and superhero franchises in particular-represents female characters, then the stakes of these films shift a little.\n",
      "This could have been The Usual Suspects or Momento of Marvel but... they don't develop the character in an origin film.\n",
      "There's not enough on the page... it's only two hours long and they kind of rushed through it.\n",
      "A plain, lazy and insipid entry. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "It's hard to see that anyone will think this is one of the better entries into the Marvel universe.\n",
      "It's the entertainment industry turned into merchandise. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The first Marvel woman to show signs of heroism is given little more than a proton blast to develop her personality.\n",
      "Lacking the wit and graphic oomph that sometimes rescues the Marvel franchise from terminal fatigue, \"Captain Marvel\" is yet another origin story for yet another superhero.\n",
      "If Captain Marvel had been lovingly crafted and shot with style, perhaps the void at its heart would have mattered less. But Larson's fighter pilot, turned galactic defender, is the central character a characterless movie deserves.\n",
      "Thoroughly unremarkable, Captain Marvel wanders aimlessly through various half-baked plotlines without ever investing in its title character.\n",
      "It really all comes down to the ho-hum writing. It's far from the worst film in the MCU, but don't be surprised if you find yourself not getting as invested as usual, or if the film ends up fading from memory faster than others.\n",
      "While not the worst of the MCU, CAPTAIN MARVEL is so much less than it should've been. Even Goose the Flerken can't save it from a lacking lead performance, dull action, awful VFX, and a clichéd, amateurish script.\n",
      "The search for a weapon lost by all and the identity of the titular captain are the pretexts for an interplanetary back and forth and... special but monotonous effects. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "It feels like a stepping-stone movie, not the powerful one we hoped for.\n",
      "Some aesthetic and narrative reluctance makes the film seem more like a rushed production to present the character before Avengers: Endgame. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The Brie Larson film has more similarities with Phase 1 MCU and it's not necessarily a bad thing. but it does feel like a step backwards. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Brie Larson isn't working with much, but still, does she have to deliver every line with such stony resignation?\n",
      "The film falls short in trying to reformulate the superhero discourse via a feminine outlook. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The efforts to mix massive action scenes with down-to-Earth humor is less of the smooth transition it needs to be to work and more of a jarring trek.\n",
      "This is by far, the worst Marvel movie since... well, pre-MCU movies or TV like when Thor appeared on The Incredible Hulk TV show way back when.\n",
      "This is more of the same, and frankly, it's getting boring.\n",
      "Even when a formidably female Captain Marvel finally gets her own film, it feels less like a standalone story and more like a placeholder.\n",
      "Surprisingly, the most disappointing thing about Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel herself.\n",
      "Captain Marvel isn't a pain to sit through...but such a venerable character long overdue on the big screen, the talents involved in putting her there and Marvel's rabidly faithful international audience deserved much better.\n",
      "Almost everything about Captain Marvel tends towards the sub-standard, from the special effects to the action sequences, the scattershot storytelling and the slapstick.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Captain Marvel, for lack of a better description, is just another Marvel movie - set to a robotic, unmemorable score; deeply reliant on old tropes; and featuring yet another underwhelming villain.\n",
      "It is unfortunate that Danvers can fly effortlessly and Samuel L. Jackson can almost recapture his younger self, but the movie cannot stretch itself to make computer-generated cables and flying cats seem natural.\n",
      "...undistinguishable from the other superhero films, except that the superhero is a woman. Apparently that's are enough to satisfy the prosaic 21st Century mind.\n",
      "Captain Marvel could not be duller beside DC's Wonder Woman if she tried. Apparently, personality is not the Captain's superpower.\n",
      "The film may be about women breaking their shackles, but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture. Humor winds up being provided by Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, heart by Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau, and pathos by...well, it ain't Larson\n",
      "Perhaps because it's too action-packed, this is an underwhelming origin story, introducing MCU's first female superhero.\n",
      "When a cat, a Stan Lee-filled opening Marvel logo, a fun cameo and making fun of 1990s computer technology steal a movie you know that movie is in deep trouble.\n",
      "The fun of 'Captain Marvel' is not so much Danvers/Marvel, but her pal Nick Fury, portrayed by the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson.\n",
      "Lord, grant me the confidence of a mediocre movie about a cosmically powered white woman.\n",
      "While noticeable out of their element, indie stalwarts Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck recognize the easy rapport between Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson is their best asset.\n",
      "It doesn't help that Captain Marvel adopts a whole slew of the MCU's other problems, from an underdeveloped villain to an avalanche lifeless CGI action.\n",
      "In the grand scheme of the Marvel Universe, however, \"Captain Marvel\" feels like a supporting player, not a featured attraction.\n",
      "Captain Marvel tries to zip and zap its way into the pop-cultural canon... Some, I suppose, will enjoy the frenzy, but for me, the point turns out to be inadvertent: Incessant movement doesn't necessarily get you anywhere.\n",
      "It's too bad [Captain Marvel's] debut movie isn't better, and less convoluted, because the character seems to have great potential, and Oscar winner Brie Larson looks like a great fit for the role.\n",
      "As it is, Captain Marvel is more a reminder of Marvel's early work (think the first Captain America or Thor) than its more recent output (Black Panther or Infinity War).\n",
      "Ultimately, Captain Marvel is one of Marvel's most baffling missteps.\n",
      "A rare misstep from a franchise factory that otherwise strides the movie landscape so assuredly.\n",
      "Captain Marvel is bright and entertaining on a basic level. But it's also something we may not have seen before: An MCU film that's kind of forgettable.\n",
      "The characters display recognisable humanity which is the film's balance but not often enough or convincingly. There's something dark and empty in all the fanfare and fuss, and it seems aimed solely at an audience that grew up in video arcades.\n",
      "The characters are undeveloped, the outlines of this universe are vague and uninteresting, and the less said about the multiple attempts at humour, the better.\n",
      "Years from now, chances are that when people sit around and talk enthusiastically about that movie with Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, the subject is most likely to be Kong: Skull Island.\n",
      "Captain Marvel rates a C. It's distinguished from other MCU movies by its female lead. Otherwise it is way too ordinary and middle of the pack.\n",
      "You would think that after 21 feature films, Marvel would have perfected the superhero origin story formula, but to Brie Larson's detriment, this time they forgot to add \"character\" and \"personality\" into the mix. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The feature's gender politics feel like a bit of a pose: too superficial to convey the source material's fiercely feminist mythology, and too desperate for applause for it to be regarded as sincere.\n",
      "This woman is a candidate for genuine heroism. Yet there's a fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script...\n",
      "It's not fair to give \"Captain Marvel,\" a perfectly passable popcorn movie, the full weight of the obscenity of this cinematic gender disparity. But after this wait, society deserved better.\n",
      "Far from marvelous...a stumble in Marvel-Disney's plan to conquer the cinematic universe.\n",
      "To be blunt, it's insulting that Marvel felt simply making its first leading woman \"one tough chick\" would be enough to placate female fans.\n",
      "We may learn Vers' true name and how she came to be a Kree warrior but we never learn enough about who she is, flaws and all, to make her anything more than another interchangeable hero in a shiny suit.\n",
      "Bizarrely, Captain Marvel is less interested in fleshing out its own hero than it is in filling in the blanks of the MCU.\n",
      "This plays like the kind of generic comic book movie that was in vogue 15 years ago.\n",
      "Perhaps in the hands of other directors, Carol might turn out to be an eye-popping force of costumed law enforcement. However, for her first adventure, \"Captain Marvel\" leaves much to be desired.\n",
      "Captain Marvel seems to hold itself to no higher standard than the absolute minimum that people tend to expect from an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Hearing a Nirvana song in a Marvel movie on the day Luke Perry died felt like a dire reckoning for this Gen Xer.\n",
      "Captain Marvel effectively makes feminism a target, a goal to be achieved in ways that feel more self-congratulatory than progressive.\n",
      "Good thing it's still March. \"Captain Marvel\" would have made a weak start to the summer blockbuster season.\n",
      "Captain Marvel, down to the eye-rolling musical choice of No Doubt's 'Just a Girl,' cares far more about lecturing audiences than entertaining them. And boy, does it show.\n",
      "Brie Larson has the credits for the role and trained extensively for it, but she is hampered by her character having amnesia through part of the story.\n",
      "Neither a blast from the past, nor an inspiring glimpse into the future, at the end of the day it's just another Marvel movie. And not a particularly good one, at that.\n",
      "This is a time-shifting space story teeming with deception at every turn, and, yet, when it reaches its finale one feels, quite frankly, un-involved by it, hell, even bored.\n",
      "A great superhero origin story hobbled by the corporation using it for their own selfish purposes.\n",
      "Marvel not only finds itself lagging behind DC with its first female super hero, but utterly losing the contest. \"Captain Marvel\" is a boring mishmash of ideas from a score of other movies and franchises...\n",
      "They've made a Marvel blockbuster that, like its central character, is entirely free of personality.\n",
      "[The] filmmakers think that in order to make someone look strong, you need to make them emotionless, and I just don't agree.\n",
      "\"A bit of a misstep at a very crucial time.\"\n",
      "Larson does get a few opportunities in Captain Marvel to be that regular, flawed-but-strong human-there just aren't enough of them, and they're hardly the focus of the movie.\n",
      "The trap the filmmakers set for themselves is this: They set out to make a girl-power statement - but feared acknowledging any differences between men and women.\n",
      "It succeeds more as an amusing fill-in-the-blanks Marvel backstory provider than a confident, stand-alone tale of a woman discovering her fierceness.\n",
      "The raw material is all there, but filmmaking itself does not yield any truly thrilling, resonant moments. The action sequences are rote, at times almost muddled.\n",
      "This outing may be more of a Meh-vel than a Marvel for me, but I'm confident that a film worthy of the hero at its centre will arrive sooner rather than later.\n",
      "These are all good reasons to root for Carol as she becomes the newest member of the MCU. But Captain Marvel doesn't highlight any of them in a rousing, snappy way.\n",
      "Only the most dedicated Marvel fans will follow this Captain.\n",
      "The character, even when kicking ass, is a total bore.\n",
      "Captain Marvel ultimately feels more obligatory than inspired, a movie that basically gets the job done and little more.\n",
      "It's everything you might expect a sci-fi superhero movie to be, if you hadn't seen one in a long time.\n",
      "The first female-led movie of the MCU deserved more.\n",
      "The picture is not dull, exactly, just mundane, marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, a bland visual style and a lack of elan in every department.\n",
      "The film doesn't pay nearly enough attention to Danvers's crucial emotional metamorphosis from dual-identity self-doubter to fearless warrior battling to keep Earth safe.\n",
      "Scenes between Fury and Larson's Carol Danvers, rediscovering her human past, are oddly inert, and the film's much-vaunted feminism, promised in months of run-up advertising and interviews, gets short-shrift.\n",
      "Director Jon Favreau tries to enliven the story with comic elements, but the plot trudges along a well-trodden path to a weary conclusion.\n",
      "Why did Iron Man seem so slight to me when I've watched it on my computer? Quite possibly these \"event\" pictures need a huge screen and a pounding sound system to convince viewers of their worth.\n",
      "Hoping to blend comic book superhero thrills ... with the relevance of the real war-torn world, 'Iron Man,' directed by Jon Favreau, fails at both endeavors.\n",
      "...suffers from an uneven and increasingly oppressive structure that ultimately negates the film's few positive attributes...\n",
      "Iron Man is a dispiriting attempt to apply superficial principles to inherently silly kid culture.\n",
      "Garden-variety pop heroism/wish-fulfillment marinated in Robert Downey Jr.'s effortless insouciant sauce.\n",
      "Sporting a novel brand of swinger superhero, Iron Man's got goofy Robert Downey Jr. wisecracking his way through unlikely feats and fantasy politics, with all the determination of someone who just wandered in from the corner bar.\n",
      "Too slow on the take off\n",
      "Downey acquits himself well enough during the action sequences in 'Iron Man,' but there just aren't enough of them and the existing ones could use a boost.\n",
      "Iron Man ... is really a four-act play in a three-act movie.\n",
      "When Iron Man is zooming above bejewelled southern California, I expected a thundering lyricism but instead settled for some routine CGI stunts. I suppose it's asking too much for a great actor to be matched up with a great director.\n",
      "Though he's been given A-list treatment...Iron Man can't escape being a little--dare I say it?--tinny....It doesn't crash, but it doesn't soar, either.\n",
      "Despite the convulsively jittery address to the role, [Downey] is never in the smallest degree engaging in the way director Jon Favreau appears to think.\n",
      "Toggling between Stark's impish goatee and Iron Man's full-metal body condom, and amid so many generic fireballs, kill shots and earsplitting thumps, bumps and crunches, the film finally collapses under its own weight.\n",
      "Downey's unbeatable charisma makes these problems less troublesome than they would be otherwise, but wouldn't it be nice if they didn't exist at all?\n",
      "There's a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show.\n",
      "Light on both CGI and moral quandaries, [it posesses] neither the zip and sparkle of a Spider-Man nor the brooding existential subtexts of Batman Begins.\n",
      "If there were any new ideas, I failed to spot them, as did my bone marrow, which slept through most of it anyhow.\n",
      "It too frequently seems that Iron Man's battles could simply be replaced with a scene featuring Stark and his opponent measuring their respective suit's RAM, with a glance towards their supporting company's share prices.\n",
      "It's much more fun to create a franchise than to doggedly sustain it.\n",
      "It's half the fun of the first movie and twice as convoluted.\n",
      "As for the actual grand finale, Downey Jr. and Cheadle seem like they're already network gaming the PS3 release instead of facing any actual threat, and Rourke goes out like a chump.\n",
      "The whiz-bang stuff here -- while never less than slick -- doesn't produce anything we haven't seen before.\n",
      "The most cynical and calculating part of it all is that the movie never really finds a justification for its existence; except, that is, as a bald-faced setup for The Avengers.\n",
      "... The visual effects, though solid, may brighten the screen but are a poor substitute for characterisation and style - those two absent friends who we miss the most during the show.\n",
      "Fans will be satisfied, even if it doesn't match the nuanced and well-rounded brilliance of the first film. But many will be disappointed with this seemingly rushed follow-up.\n",
      "There's an outdated feel to it all, from its cold-war view of America to the AC/DC soundtrack.\n",
      "Crasser, noisier, more metallic\n",
      "All of the charm and romance of the original has been ironed out by excess.\n",
      "Tony Stark is Dick Cheney's foreign policy driven by Grover Norquist's fiscal policy, sold to the public by Ari Gold. Very confusing.\n",
      "You won't find a more overqualified cast this year. Then out come the CGI effects and everything becomes a yawn.\n",
      "Sometimes simple is better. The original thrived on few integral characters and a world-wise approach to storytelling. This feature seems to think action is more important than story and an overabundance of characters is a necessity.\n",

      "The over-hyped Jon Favreau movie, \"Iron Man 2,\" is a downer and a disappointment, especially when compared to the entertaining first movie that came before it.\n",
      "I cannot imagine that anyone intimately involved with the making of Iron Man 2 would ever, on their own dime and their own time, ever go to see a movie like Iron Man 2.\n",
      "Aesthetically, 'Iron Man 2' is a polished flick. Plot wise, it's almost as bad as 'Catwoman.'\n",
      "Iron Man 2 is exactly what critics and audiences deserve following the celebration of that awful, dung-hued first film.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 careens between self-awareness and self-promotion, which is not to say these are opposite conditions.\n",
      "Like the original this is a movie I don't particularly mind but don't exactly love, either.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 could be Chaplin Meets The Wrestler Meets Shakespeare in Love Meets Stan Lee. Instead it's more The Stooges Meet Sara Lee.\n",
      "Pales beside the original.\n",
      "Entertaining enough but falls short of delivering much of anything new.\n",
      "Its a collection of scenes where stuff happens but not a real movie. The first Iron Man proved it could be smart AND entertaining. This is just mildly ok in parts.\n",
      "Entertaining ... but long stretches of the movie are more fizzle than sizzle.\n",
      "a Republican fantasy of big guns, cool gadgets, fast cars, non-threatening women to objectify and the corpses of Cold War bogeys propped up like ideological scarecrows.\n",

      "In one fell swoop, director Jon Favreau has driven this once-promising series straight into the ground.\n",
      "Casting the likes of Downey and Rourke and then imprisoning them in jointed refrigerators is resource-squandering of the highest order.\n",
      "The movie settles into a series of ho-hum conflicts and complications, and the requisite slam-bang ending is perfunctory at best.\n",
      "[Downey] gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story.\n",
      "This sequel, alas, settles for old elements in a new alloy -- less iron, lots more lead and tin.\n",
      "More like IRON MAN 1.5\n",
      "You're left wanting more, but not quite the \"more\" Iron Man 2 works so hard to supply.\n",
      "While the title is \"Iron Man 2,\" what we're being given is \"Iron Man Squared.\" There's too much going on, and all the characters and plots and revelations and foreshadowings do not fill the film but bloat it.\n",

      "This mega-mecha melee manages to give short shrift to both the airborne action set-pieces that define Iron Man's zoomy panache and incoming supervillain Whiplash.\n",
      "Often playing like it has been jury-rigged from bits and pieces of a longer, smarter movie, Iron Man 2 seems chiefly intended as a placeholder for its next dozen or so sequels.\n",
      "The big problem with Iron Man 2, maybe, is that it so dutifully gives the people what they want, instead of giving them what they didn't know they wanted.\n",
      "Flabby, disjointed, and eschewing conflict for extended scenes of improv clowning, it's the Superheroic equivalent of a Rat Pack film.\n",
      "The substance of the original Iron Man, the brain and the soul that set it apart from the typical seasonal fare and made it one of the best films of 2008, also have been blown to bits.\n",
      "Appealing mainly to male special effects fans, this high octane, low intellect thing has only two performances worth watching, by Larry Shandling and Sam Rockwell.\n",
      "Although it's stuffed with subplots, gadgets and bad guys, this tinny contraption is half-hearted.\n",
      "Talky, curiously depressing for most of its running-time, weighed down by too many heroes and an army of uninteresting villains, and messily prosaic in the big action moments, 'Iron Man 2' suggests that this franchise is already running on fumes.\n",

      "Iron Man 2 simply simply isn't as satisfying as its predecessor.\n",
      "There's so much clunky exposition in the script attributed to Justin Theroux that it seems forever before the first action sequence, which has surprisingly mediocre special effects.\n",
      "A major disappointment. I hated arrogant, bratty, foot-stomping man-baby Tony Stark and prissy Pepper Potts. Too much brattle and no story.\n",
      "Downey's head and heart are in the right place, but the movie is more in pieces than whole, and more about iron than about men.\n",
      "Only the first of who knows how many sequels, and those clunky ferrous fashionistas are already getting a little, well, rusty. Downey retains his Chaplinesque eccentric charm, but it's wearing thin, adding up to a sequel with a serious Iron deficiency.\n",
      "No matter how against the grain the superhero's origins seemed in Part 1, or how uniquely Robert Downey Jr. played them, a second helping of Iron Man has some \"wow\" issues to work out.\n",
      "Upgraded with the latest CGI hardware but also more shoddy screenwriting software than its system can withstand, Iron Man 2 is an example of subtraction by addition.\n",
      "If you listen and read closely, the positive reviews will be cloaking their praise of Iron Man 2 in rationalizations, rather than letting it flow unfettered.\n",
      "A series of carefully-planned, effects-heavy sequences strung together with slapdash storytelling, underdeveloped character ideas and the occasional funny line of dialogue.\n",
      "Twice the snark, half the fun. The original's wit and energy shrivel into countless subplots and so little excitement that the sequel barely qualifies as an action movie.\n",
      "Has it finally happened? Hard as it is to type, Robert Downey Jr. may have reached obnoxiousness.\n",
      "The idea is that we learn to trust that any extraneous-seeming thread will connect to something in another couple of summers and pay off, assuming the movie does.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 feels less like a proper sequel and more like an extended, very expensive infomercial for Marvel's future superhero movie slate.\n",
      "It's good enough to keep the fans happy, but no more. Nothing I say will deter teenage boys who want to see it, but if you go with them, take ear plugs.\n",
      "This supposedly iron clad sequel is only fit to rust in the superhero scrap yard.\n",
      "All this extra effort drains the inherent sense of what was fun about the original, darkening it with issues and complexities that unnecessarily muddy the crisp, clearly commercial premise.\n",
      "Iron Man was a rare blockbuster that stayed with you -- the sequel all but evaporates the moment it cuts to black.\n",
      "Thanks to Downey Jr, this is a winning formula. Director Jon Favreau's mistake was to add to it.\n",
      "The original Iron Man left some pretty big shoes to fill, and rather than rise to the challenge, the sequel opts to play it safe.\n",
      "Marvel are so excited about The Avengers that they've decided to make a 2-hour advert for it, pass it off as a film and charge admission.\n",
      "Loaded with laughs but short on action, this big-budget sequel feels less like a comic book flick and more like a superhero version of 'Arthur.'\n",
      "The film slumps into the doldrums early on, and truth is, it never recovers. For a film so heavy on characters, it's shamefully light on plot.\n",
      "A hugely entertaining first act is let down by a lacklustre second in a sequel often more concerned with setting up future Marvel efforts than delivering on its predecessor's promise.\n",
      "Given the strength of part one, the sequel is not just a terrific failure but a terrific disappointment.\n",
      "Everything fun and terrific about Iron Man, a mere two years ago, has vanished with its sequel. In its place, Iron Man 2 has substituted noise, confusion, multiple villains, irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines.\n",

      "The film runs much more smoothly than Lee's arguably overstuffed take on the material, but it also cuts out anything that isn't purely surface.\n",
      "The Incredible Hulk makes noises about a return, but it seems doubtful audiences will keep the faith for a third try -- at least, with Hulk as the sole star.\n",
      "Rather than go to the trouble of crafting a dramatically satisfying conclusion, The Incredible Hulk\" blows the audience off and takes the air out of its previous solid work by ending with what is essentially a shameless trailer for the next Marvel movie.\n",
      "There comes a point when all this action starts to feel a bit mechanical.\n",
      "An improvement over the first Hulk feature, it is still a far cry from the qualify of work achieved with Iron Man.\n",
      "The Hulk is one of Marvel Comics more unsuccessfully developed superheroes. He is more of a scared animal striking out at his tormentors rather than a thinking being that acts with a conscience.\n",
      "Leterrier's reboot might be a tighter, more coherent movie than Ang Lee's freaky-deaky, artsy-fartsy 2003 Hulk. But it's also way less interesting.\n",
      "The sheer craft directors such as Leterrier lavish on them is awesome to me. I can't imagine how they orchestrate all the little pieces of film they require to build their big set pieces... [But] Why do they bother?\n",
      "The grand acting chops of Norton and Roth fall prey to action which is more noisy than memorable and fails to carry a script lacking in impact, depth and originality.\n",
      "This is just another case of special effects overwhelming an action film.\n",
      "Sound and fury signifying nothing, indeed.\n",
      "It's dismaying to think of all the wonderful performances Edward Norton has given in movies nobody ever saw. This one is high-octane slumming that will keep him in Bentleys for years.\n",
      "A wholly mediocre comic movie...to belabor the pun that everyone else has already belabored, there's nothing about it that's even a little bit incredible.\n",
      "Digital spectacle is both too much and too little, and it's beginning to put some of us in a funk of disappointment and boredom. When you've seen one half-ton piece of metal flung through the air, you've seen them all.\n",
      "The chief fault of The Incredible Hulk is that it aims to be the diametric opposite of Lee's, and it jettisons what actually worked.\n",
      "By the time the Hulk is battling the Abomination it's simply watching two special effects go after each other. Were Norton and Roth even on the set?\n",
      "Nothing that the director Louis Leterrier or the writer Zak Penn did by pumping up the action could take away from the film's ordinariness... .\n",
      "Not much special about this Hulk, including a reason to make it in the first place.\n",
      "Slow pacing and a muted sound production only add to the CGI disaster inflicted on what should have been a believable superhero created with 21st century technology.\n",
      "In their determination to make a reliable action movie, they forgot to make an interesting one.\n",
      "A smash-and-slash affair. This probably bodes well for the franchise but ill for those of us who think the world would be a better place with at least one less conflicted comic book antihero glutting the megaplexes.\n",
      "The inevitable comparisons to\n",
      "Part of the problem is the computer-generated Hulk. It's OK in the early going, when the big green guy is mostly hidden by darkness or smoke. But in the light of day he looks cartoonish.\n",
      "The sad truth is, a movie Hulk is less a force of nature and more a pathetic weakling.\n",
      "Its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface.\n",
      "Marvel is so busy setting up the next sale that they can't see the mediocrity built into their own formula.\n",
      "Hulk is further proof that the superhero genre has entered its mediocre period.\n",
      "There are just too many \"almosts\" attached to this Hulk.\n",
      "All action and no storytelling.\n",
      "Why remake a crappy movie five years later if it's only going to be marginally less crappy?\n",
      "Don't get attached to the actors in The Incredible Hulk. All of them are sidelined for the last half-hour of the drab, monotonous film.\n",
      "When it's fighting, it's fun -- but, when it isn't, it's not.\n",
      "Comic book performances trample Norton's attempt at 3D, e.g., Tim Blake Nelson's over-the-top scientist, acting as if he's performing children's theater to a packed matinee of pre-schoolers.\n",
      "When the Hulk turns back, he often finds himself naked, aching, and disoriented in Guatemala, the fate of many a Spring Breaker\n",
      "...a simple monster romp.\n",
      "The finale's slugfest plays out like the WWF gone CGI -- characters bash each other, things go boom, and (how typical) a lot of it is too quickly paced to follow.\n",
      "This Hulk isn't incredible; it's just mediocre...a very conventional comic-book movie, a considerable step down from Lee's more imaginative treatment.\n",
      "...Adolescent heaven personified with endless, wallopin' fights between WWF-looking steroidians, highlighting a mindless production akin to a widescreen video game. In the oft pounded word of The Hulk himself, 'Grrrrr!'\n",
      "If you can clock a feature film by its transformations (25-&-50) style and still wish that you could skip through the commercials in-between, precisely how far removed are you from what's come before.\n",
      "Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn dispense with the angst and focus on the smash. The result is a movie that eschews dialogue (or anything resembling an idea, for that matter) in favor of hyper-violent mayhem and unconvincing CGI.\n",
      "The lack of character shading suggests Marvel Studios went too far in distancing itself from Lee's much-reviled predecessor. Could a better balance between brawn and brains not have been struck?\n",
      "The whole thing plays like it's been focus-grouped to death, stripped of any real personality of its own.\n",
      "In The Incredible Hulk, Betty handles her role as The Girl in unusual and frankly charming ways: she's easily the film's most impressive effect.\n",
      "It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences\n",
      "Astute fans may detect a whiff of studio formula here.\n",
      "It's a step in the right direction with some top-notch moments, and hardcore fans will still walk away with a giddy smile - but it's not in the same sort of league as Spider-Man 2, Iron Man or Batman Begins.\n",
      "It's high-energy, but oddly unsatisfying; the nature of Hulk's rage is left unexplored and undeveloped.\n",
      "A thudding dull and dunderheaded piece of product that is generally uninteresting to look at, frequently painful to listen to and a constant insult to all the things that Ang Lee accomplished in his take on the material.\n",
      "An Incredible Misfire\n",
      "The Hulk looks like a dark, shiny, muscular pickle.\n",
      "[Norton] seems to resent that in the Fight Club food chain, he's Edward Norton and not Brad Pitt.\n",
      "The audience at my screening cheered the most loudly when Stan Lee, Ferrigno and characters from other Marvel titles appeared for their cameos. If the movie had worked a little better on its own, the Hulk would have gotten more applause just for himself.\n",
      "Alas, The Incredible Hulk is no Iron Man, and a brief appearance by a devilishly goateed Tony Stark only serves to remind us of that fact.\n",
      "What is so disappointing about the film is how much of a lesser experience it is than Ang Lee's Hulk.\n",
      "Even if there weren't script and performance deficiencies -- and there certainly are -- the big problem with both Hulk movies is that the lead character is an unconvincing CG creation.\n",
      "That Leterrier is not particularly strong with character and acting further compounds the problem, leaving audiences with little to cling to but cartoon monsters and cardboard humans.\n",
      "Me no like new Hulk much.\n",
      "Hulk. Smash. But not Smash Movie.\n",
      "The first film's main problem dogs this one as well: A dull story. The villain is big and loud, and Banner has a good heart, but neither makes for an interesting character.\n",
      "Thanks to Norton's curiously zombified performance, we have little incentive to root for Banner to learn to control his anger.\n",
      "This new film might have its moments and the character might still have his angry superpowers, but that doesn't make it anything close to incredible.\n",
      "Can I simply come out and say what is rarely mentioned but we all know to be true? The Hulk is an uninspired comic-book creation.\n",
      "It's difficult to know what the filmmakers were going for with this recast sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk.\n",

      "Blandly directed, ham-fisted sound and fury battering your brain for attention [that leaves] you with little to take away except, perhaps, a mild headache. Where is Ang Lee when we need him?\n",

      "Thor...as in bore? Bingo.\n",

      "Let's hope Branagh was well-compensated, at least. To quote his favorite author: No profit grows where is no pleasure taken.\n",
      "... not to say that Thor is awful, simply uninspired, full of sound and fury and not much else.\n",
      "...although it looks good, it feels fragmented, the action never coming fully to life and the central character rather colorless.\n",
      "Branagh's chosen style (and that's a generous term to use here) pretty much consists of tilting the camera about forty degrees every fifth or sixth shot.\n",

      "Although it looks quite beautiful and has enough gorgeous space shots to make Nova green with envy, the movie is too weighted down by exposition to ever really get interesting.\n",
      "The story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with Thor, Odin and the others played by piglets. In the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation.\n",

      "A merely adequate introductory saga coated in hammy regality by director Kenneth Branagh.\n",
      "Thor continues the trend of weakly jumpstarting a franchise based on a Marvel comic with an instantly forgettable origin story.\n",
      "Everything aboutThor seems afterthought and cast-off, from its cheap-looking production values and dull action to its flat script. It's telling that Chris Hemsworth's shirtless scene is the movie's most special effect.\n",
      "It's still inconceivable that people could look at the shabby Iron Man 1 and gaudy Iron Man 2 and be satisfied. The latest addition to that Marvel studios franchise is Thor, and it, too, suffers from filmmaking without wit.\n",
      "An overlong, mildy entertaining blockbuster that could have used a more charismatic lead as well as more palpable thrills and excitement.\n",
      "Thor is such a monumental waste of top tier talent, it adds an air of sadness to this prime example of cookie cutter filmmaking.\n",
      "... latest in a string of whatever-sticks action-hero franchises ... I can hear the slumming Branagh admonishing, \"Give me a break ‒ it's an amusement-park ride!\n",

      "This is eminently missable, though the mosaic design of Asgard, Thor's mythical realm, is pretty cool.\n",
      "I approached this new lollapalooza with an open mind that was quickly addled by loads of back story and front story and an ear-splitting avalanche of special effects.\n",
      "Branagh's direction looks the same as that of any other summer tentpole manager, and things go boom.\n",
      "Essentially, when the movie comes down to Earth it's pretty good. But when it spends time across the universe -- and it spends a lot of time across the universe -- it's pure geek fare. Which may thrill geeks but leave others yawning.\n",
      "Talk loudly and carry a big hammer\n",
      "Thor seems to have little more on its mind than winning the first weekend and making its money back overseas, which it probably, predictably, will.\n",
      "All that director Kenneth Branagh must do with Thor is not mess it up, and he succeeds. The results aren't as exhilarating as the first Iron Man, but Downey can't play every superhero...For sheer fun and action, I'd prefer seeing Fast Five again.\n",
      "Many things within Thor must be accepted at face value, but these very things are what make the whole enterprise feel inconsequential.\n",
      "Thor has the feel of a film that never quite starts.\n",
      "Next to 'Iron Man 2,' 'Thor' is the worst Marvel film to date.\n",
      "Basically, it's a little better than okay -- but nothing more than that.\n",
      "It's as if Branagh, fearful that his artsy reputation precedes him, has gone to the opposite extreme and low-balled the material.\n",
      "It starts pretty promisingly, and it stays pretty promising throughout, and at some point you realize it's never actually going to deliver on that promise.\n",
      "The ripping outer-space fights are the main attraction, and they're mostly entertaining, though not in a way that will make you feel good about yourself.\n",
      "At times it seems Thor's hammer shows more personality than its owner.\n",
      "If this is a harbinger of the season to come, may heaven and its suburbs help us.\n",
      "Thor suffers from Iron Man 2 syndrome: too much backstory, too many subplots and character introductions, and not nearly enough full-frontal nudity from Natalie Portman, who frankly is given very little to work with here.\n",
      "Chris Hemsworth is a double order of handsome with a side of charming. But Thor has that retread feel.\n",
      "All the requisite ingredients are wedged in: romance, redemption, a giant invincible robot. But it seems no one was paying attention to overall quality control.\n",
      "Branagh does what he can to add a dash of humor here and there, but so much of \"Thor\" is postproduction animation - pretty, but every object has the insubstantial feel of the digital hand.\n",
      "\"Thor\" has its strengths, but it is finally something of a mishmash with designs on being more interesting than it manages to be.\n",
      "With its references to other properties in the Marvel universe and to classic tales of redemption, this no-surprises summer movie might appeal to those who've been bitten by radioactive spiders or the Shakespeare bug.\n",
      "Truly a mishmash, by turns mythic and realistic, serious and ridiculous, humorous and risible, Shakespearean and modern, naive and cool, straightforward and loopy.\n",
      "A howling turkey is at least something to laugh at, and maybe even something to see. But \"Thor\" is an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination.\n",
      "The only impressive thing about Thor is his wingspan.\n",
      "No matter how the filmmakers move Heaven and Earth, this comic-book adaptation looks cool but contains very little thunder.\n",
      "It succeeds only on the most basic level.\n",
      "Branagh tries not to lose that connection but he's overwhelmed by design and technology, like many who would enter the arena of fantasy blockbuster movie-making.\n",
      "[It's] confusing because it's been getting reasonably favorable word of mouth despite the fact that it's as thoroughly a mediocre superhero movie as you'd care to imagine.\n",
      "As great as Hemsworth and Hiddleston are, they cannot overcome the film's flaws. All they can do is drag THOR up from awful to fairly tolerable.\n",
      "Gods and monsters be damned, Thor is still the same old origin story, indistinguishable from the dozens we've seen in summers past.\n",
      "Thor is a Thor movie and it doesn't do anything to sell me on the mythology... Even though I've never read a Thor comic, I knew exactly what would happen... And I'm sorry, armor on earth looks silly.\n",

      "Somebody, somewhere, is proud of the art direction and animation that brings this city to life, but it just looks like a Lord of the Rings fan film.\n",
      "It wants to impress with dazzling special effects rather than through an emotive, captivating story.\n",
      "Sounds kind of corny, you say? Oh, that's nothing. Massive corn-shucking in this film, corn piled everywhere, cornpone, corn fritters, corn syrup, corn as high as an elephant's eye, the Feast of Our Great God Corn!\n",
      "This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done.\n",
      "The special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative, and the film is unduly protracted.\n",

      "The filmmakers play a conservative game, not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise.\n",
      "One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience.\n",
      "By the time the utterly routine (and decidedly endless) finale rolls around, Marvel's The Avengers has unquestionably squandered the potential of its premise and its cast...\n",

      "Superhero movies -- with their franchises, massive marketing budgets, cross-merchandising synergy and dedication to presenting the same experience every single time -- are nothing if not the Mickey D's of cinema, and I'm sure not lovin' it.\n",
      "There are also the fans who rage in the comments, as if men in spandex are as serious as war and the economy. Is there a defensive euphoria in seeing your childhood heroes come to life? Is 'The Avengers' a great film? No. Will people love it? Yes!\n",
      "Yet another brainless, overbloated and mostly underwhelming blockbuster despite marvelous visual effects.\n",
      "A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-\"Transformers\" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax.\n",
      "What the Avengers really need is something to avenge, some compelling emotion or commitment; rallying the troops with blood-stained collectible trading cards doesn't cut it.\n",

      "Biff! Bam! Boring!\n",
      "The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\n",
      "To watch another comic book transformed into another blockbuster is to \"marvel\" at much and to feel nothing - that's a safer bet than the converse, perhaps, which may explain the genre's popularity.\n",
      "If you're not much of a Marvel Comics person but just want to get an early start on your mindless summer moviegoing, well, I guess this picture is no stupider than anything else.\n",
      "Really, who cares about another battle? We know how this is going to end.\n",
      "The picture is broken down into narrative chunks that ultimately don't tell much of a story - what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters.\n",
      "The Avengers has a knockout final 30 minutes, all gee-whiz crash and bang and eye candy that makes grand use of 3D and IMAX and all the other toys. But the Transformers movies did that, too.\n",

      "The subtitle may be The Dark World, but the only dark things about this world are the long, dull speeches and terrible costumes. Any attempt at sub-RSC portentousness falls flat.\n",
      "Overall, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining, if inconsequential, action-fantasy with another great turn by Tom Hiddleston as Loki.\n",
      "When Thor: The Dark World doesn't work-and it doesn't, far too frequently-it's when the writers and director take the whole thing much too seriously.\n",
      "Save for Hiddleston's too-brief supporting turn, this is mighty forgettable stuff, a by-the-numbers sequel to what was already the slightest and least entertaining of the 'Avengers' components.\n",
      "How long are you fans going to put up with this kind of slack nonsense?\n",
      "When Marvel brought in Alan Taylor, the director of Game of Thrones, to invigorate the Thor franchise, many hoped for a breast-bearing, dwarf-battling, blood-spurting melodrama -- with capes and hammers. Sadly, it was not to be.\n",
      "The superhero gets a second solo album with Thor: The Dark World, which manages to outpace the first Thor in terms of atonality and gobbledygook.\n",
      "Pacing is a problem, as sequences setting up an intergalactic finale drag, particularly when the film spends far more time on Asgard, with almost none of the fish-out-of-water charm that made the first film work.\n",
      "With its dark elves, some kind of lava beast known as the Kurse, and too much time spent walking around in cloaks, the sequel too often feels like watered-down Tolkien.\n",
      "At least sixty percent of the film consists of characters frantically hurling monster-sized gobs of exposition regarding the increasingly arbitrary rules of this fantasy universe.\n",
      "Populated by bland characters and saturated with tedious dialogue.\n",

      "\"Thor\"t of good. Decent effects but not that ab-thor-bing.\n",
      "If \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry were alive today to witness \"Thor: The Dark World,\" he'd tell it to focus on being a superhero film rather than failing to dabble in science fiction.\n",
      "A familiar world in danger story that should bring yawns to all those like me who are not fans of this genre.\n",
      "At least the Thor-Loki narrative thread is worth unwinding. Too bad it's twisted up with all the overblown blockbuster nonsense.\n",
      "A surprising lack of passion in this movie, as someone apparently mistook Dark World to mean Brooding, Lethargic World.\n",
      "The ambitious Game of Thrones-esque mythology can't mask the fact that this superhero entry is just another piece of mildly satisfying, disposable entertainment.\n",
      "The battle scenes in Thor: The Dark World are interminable and muddy, thanks to the 3-D technology that makes everything look darker than it should.\n",
      "Like so many comic book epics these days, Alan Taylor's 3-D Thor: The Dark World is both monumental and generic.\n",
      "Thor is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman and, as with The Man of Steel, it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible.\n",
      "Loki... fittingly, gets all the best moments and the actor clearly relishes the way his character enjoys being evil.\n",
      "If the Thor crazy persists, audiences may finally realize how weird all this stuff is.\n",
      "Poor Thor. Dude can't even hold center stage in his own movie. He's the Asgardian god of stolen thunder, upstaged at each ab turn by Loki, malarkey and Odin's eyepatch.\n",
      "Marvel has seemed to turn Thor into one giant joke. The plot is a mess, the effects look cheap, and Kat Dennings' annoying character practically dominates the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD is one major letdown!\n",
      "True, this sequel gets better as it goes along, but that's a very steep climb just to arrive at not bad.\n",
      "Despite its entertaining lineage and a few cool sequences, \"Thor: The Dark World\" feels like filler, designed to keep the engines running and the fan base primed for the next \"Avengers\" outing in 2015.\n",
      "Can we please cease and desist with movies where not just the fate of a person, or a family, or a city, or even a world but where THE FATE OF ALL EXISTENCE is at stake? Wouldn't it be nice to see a superhero simply rescue a puppy sometime?\n",
      "Its monsters and angry armies and visual effects are interchangeable with Peter Jackson's Tolkien pics, with Clash of the Titans, with The Avengers, with Man of Steel, and on and on.\n",
      "The first film in the Avengers canon to feel like a contractual obligation.\n",
      "There's much talk in \"The Dark World\" of the Nine Realms all coming into alignment for the first time in 5,000 years, but that's nothing - try and keep nine superhero franchises lined up.\n",
      "By Odin's beard, my eyes!\n",
      "This is a sequel that, compared to the original, is unequal, with pointless, dull CGI battles in Thor's pointless, dull outer realms.\n",
      "A pit stop in Marvel's long march toward total archive monetization.\n",
      "It's all built around so much clanging of swords and denting of armor, but lacking that spark of life that the Avengers family of films is built upon.\n",
      "Marvel Studios hammers out yet another semi-leaden bit of comic-book bombast with 'Thor: The Dark World.'\n",
      "The sequel feels like another in the long line of origin stories for any given superhero.\n",
      "When the battles kicked in, semi-yawn. We've seen it all before.\n",
      "If I'm spending that much time studying Odin's grooming, there's something wrong with the story, which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads.\n",
      "This action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts.\n",
      "Dancing above a leaden plot and lumpy dialogue, Mr. Hiddleston moves his fine-boned features and graceful body, as if what he were doing matters; he seems imported from a quite different movie.\n",
      "A brainless, chaotic piece of comic-book hokum so loud and action-packed that by the end you might feel you've been clobbered over the head by the hero's big old hammer.\n",
      "The arbitrary and generic plot points and devices in \"The Dark World\" - in which Thor must save the Nine Realms from destruction - are slippery from overuse.\n",
      "we can hardly pay attention to the dense exposition because we're too busy thinking of ways to make fun of it on Twitter later\n",
      "\"Thor: The Dark World,\" unfortunately, makes good on its portentous title.\n",
      "Delivers adequate superhero adventure in a fairly generic manner.\n",
      "Not enough Loki. Too many tacky 3D effects. And then there's the hard fact that everything old isn't necessarily new again just because the bottom line wishes it so.\n",
      "The clutter makes your head feel like it's about to explode - and not in a good way, with wonders upon wonders. Instead it seems like arcana that might show up on the midterm final: the next Marvel movie.\n",
      "Leaden, non-involving and filled with mind-numbing computer-generated effects.\n",
      "Taylor doesn't do anything particularly interesting with the staging or the photography, and the CGI is so obvious and ever-present that the film begins to take on, not the look of fantasy, but cheap unreality.\n",
      "At a time when Marvel Studios should be building on their success and embarking on more ambitious narratives, Thor: The Dark Side takes three steps back.\n",
      "It is a film that simply fades into the background of other films, both already produced and still-to-come.\n",
      "These movies make me think how lovely Thor and Jane's kids would be but not how majestically dreamy their bond is.\n",
      "What's missing from The Dark World is a real sense of danger or suspense and genuine connections between the characters.\n",
      "The story is ridiculously complicated.\n",
      "It isn't an obvious disaster, but its undeniable mediocrity is just as disappointing as if it were outright terrible.\n",
      "How do you know that Thor: The Dark World is for the fan-boys and absolutely nobody else? The opening exposition is sub-Tolkien balderdash that merely has the power to put you to sleep in seconds.\n",
      "director Alan Taylor's (HBO's 'Game of Thrones') ploy is to revert to comedy whenever the plot stops making sense. Too often, we're treated to the sight of Stellan Skarsgrd (as scientist Erik Selvig) running around without his pants on.\n",
      "It's like the Disney/Marvel machine has worked up such a giant head of steam releasing comic book movies that nobody has bothered to notice that some of the movies aren't very good.\n",
      "For all the references to the previous movies and the current Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. show, this is a movie that seems unable to find any justification for its own existence.\n",
      "Too much hammer time, not enough fun, except when Loki's onscreen.\n",
      "This is a superhero movie that feels like it might have been made by anyone and no one at the same time, simply space-filler before the next big team-up movie.\n",
      "If \"The Lord of the Rings\" was ancient legends sifted through the sensibility of an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon studies, then \"Thor: The Dark World\" is grand Norse myth run through the minds of 9-year-olds.\n",
      "An inelegant misfire, this is a chink in Marvel's otherwise solid armor.\n",
      "A leaden-footed mess, bulky and uninvolving...computerized movie-making, built with algorithms and tropes and very little actual humanity..Thor-mageddon ain't much fun..\n",
      "It's not a stinker by any means - in a vacuum, this movie would be a perfectly serviceable fantasy film. But as a Marvel movie, it suggests that these things are becoming progressively more formulaic\n",
      "The whole thing cost about $200m. But the best thing about it is still an old Swede in his pants.\n",
      "Perhaps at this point, even diehards may wish for something more from a Marvel equation that often subtracts humanity.\n",
      "As Thor matures, his ego shrinks -- along with his identity.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World leaves viewers with a fitfully enjoyable, but mostly flavorless mush to tide themselves over with until next year's offerings.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World feels hopelessly derivative, a follow-up whose grandiose scale fails to conceal its lack of original ideas, not to mention flagrant logical problems.\n",
      "Hokum for overgrown kids, accessorised with daft dialogue.\n",
      "While Thor: The Dark World is fun in places it's far from a satisfying experience.\n",
      "Drab, bloated and stuck together with special effects that look like high-end Microsoft screensavers.\n",
      "There's more than enough here for the comic book lot. But the rest of us have probably seen enough space portals, mid-air punch-ups and tepid love stories to last us an Asgardian lifetime.\n",
      "It feels entirely made by committee - the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight.\n",
      "While enjoyable in spots, 'The Dark World' is haphazard and ultimately unsatisfying.\n",
      "What it doesn't offer is much in the way of originality -- or lucidity.\n",
      "Small-town scenes are the movie's best, and come closest to finding the elusive human connection that the series lacks.\n",
      "IM3 is sure to sate its fan base, but it won't endear a new crowd.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans -- and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 is an decent movie that really should have been far better with this pedigree.\n",
      "The finale is explosive, but Iron Man has some rusty patches too\n",
      "A regression in the usual strong work from Marvel Studios, Iron Man 3 suffers from director Shane Black's mishandling of this popular superhero character.\n",
      "Are you sick of superheroes? No, of course you are not, cinema audiences are lapping up any caped crusader movies. But I am, especially when Tony Stark is an angst ridden shambles suffering from performance anxiety. What's so super about that?\n",
      "It's nothing but a collection of superhero clichs made marginally palatable by Robert Downey Jr.'s endless charm and charisma.\n",
      "Same old tired effects to go along with more Downey smugness.\n",
      "A lumbering half-assed attempt at self-seriousness with lots of stuff blowing up, a smattering of repartee, one excellent sequence, and a brace of uninteresting villains.\n",
      "The trouble is that, as the plot quickens, any cleverness withdraws, to make way for the firecrackers of the climax. That is not Black's forte, and his movie duly slumps into a mess.\n",
      "Suffers from franchise rust.\n",
      "Like the suits Tony Stark pilots by remote throughout the film, it feels like an empty shell, all sleek and shiny and looking the part on the surface but hollow at the core.\n",
      "While not a complete failure as visceral eye-candy, Iron Man 3 substitutes schmaltz for inspiration and novelty. It's disappointing that what appears to be the franchise's last chapter goes out not with a bang, but with a shrug.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 is missing that old Tony Stark spark. Not from Robert Downey Jr., who is still the best thing about this overblown show, with his smarter-than-thou charisma intact even while his character emotionally falls apart.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. It's more Cuisinart than art.\n",
      "A movie so block-headed, so aimlessly busy, you'd think Michael Bay directed the thing. Actually, that would be an upgrade.\n",
      "The action, directed by Shane Black, ranges from passable to interminable.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 is a primer on how not to handle a superhero sequel--but Paltrow's abs look great!\n",
      "Black chooses to pump up the action to a size that makes it hard to focus the film's actual excitement.\n",
      "After a while, the steady diet of tongue-in-cheek starts to taste monotonous as day-old gum.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 starts off great but crashes and burns in a spectacular way. We get it Marvel you don't give a crap about your Comic Book readers. You don't have to constantly rub in people's faces. Horrible 3rd act.\n",
      "At this point, franchise fatigue definitely takes over.\n",
      "Se Tony Stark faz rir com eficincia, seus momentos dramticos soam rasos em funo da sensao de que estamos apenas vendo Robert Downey Jr. interpretando Robert Downey Jr. enquanto este vive Stark.\n",
      "a surprisingly tedious checklist of Shane Black-isms\n",
      "A superhero in film is only as good as his villain. And that's a critical problem for Iron Man 3.\n",
      "A Clunky Debut to Marvel's Phase 2.\n",
      "The biggest problem is a common one: TMVS, or Too Many Villains Syndrome.\n",
      "It would be just a special-effects-and-hardware extravaganza, with a dead-end script full of wrong turns, were it not for Robert Downey Jr. and a game and witty cast.\n",
      "From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering, fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability, Iron Man 3 is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in.\n",
      "The third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison.\n",
      "If it were not for (Robert) Downey (Jr.), \"Iron Man 3\" would be a total disaster, undermined by a haphazard, disjointed and sloppy plot.\n",
      "\"Iron Man 3\" suffers an identity crisis resembling that of the title superhero's alter-ego, billionaire Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr.\n",
      "The action plays like a video game because, well, it may as well be.\n",
      "Dark, gloomy, chaotic and basically misanthrophic...Iron Man in Dark Knight territory.\n",
      "But for all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit.\n",
      "One major sequence nearly saves the whole endeavor, but what Black has here is flat and overstuffed with contrived comic book business, feeling about as heavy and immobile as Stark's famous armor.\n",
      "The first film might have been able to get by on charm alone, but the mechanical feeling of this entry will more than likely leave you cold and indifferent.\n",
      "It's lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is.\n",
      "The \"Iron Man\" films turned Mr. Downey into a huge star, but the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him.\n",
      "Unfortunately, [its] sharp-eyed domestic comedy is dwarfed by the far less well-written supervillain crime plot that surrounds it.\n",
      "It's hard not to wish Downey were sparring with his costumed comrades again, instead of trading barbs with the far-less-colorful cast members-old and new-of this busy, sporadically diverting sequel.\n",
      "With superhero movies, over time the mythology gets junked up with tertiary characters and leftover storylines. Tony Stark & Co. have taken the Iron Man franchise as far as it can go.\n",
      "A clanging approximation of fun.\n",
      "\"Iron Man 3\" might not be a total bust, but it does result in one big \"meh.\"\n",
      "This [Tony] Stark is an anonymous shadow of his former self-promoting self.\n",
      "Stupid and messy. The Most Beautiful Woman in the World has to go. Pepper must take \"Happy\" with her.\n",
      "A shrug of a film ... that has the diminutive stature of a DVD extra.\n",
      "It's not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last year's Avengers delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this year's Marvel.\n",
      "When you are making a smart movie and end up getting dumb because \"that's the way it has to be... it's a studio movie... they need sequel options...,\" it's really a shame.\n",
      "Iron Man loses his clothes more often than a Kardsashian.\n",
      "Pepper has always been what grounded Tony, what connected him to reality. Iron Man 3 ultimately disconnects Pepper from reality...Whether or not Tony deserves better, Pepper certainly does.\n",
      "This film resembles its protagonist Tony Stark: its overblown, convoluted and seemingly disconnected to anything that has come before it.\n",
      "The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 isn't a Blockbuster, it's a Blandbuster -- boring and safe and riddled with plot holes and filled with product placement.\n",
      "There's so much dumb stuff in \"Iron Man 3\" that I expected the credits to say, \"Written and directed by Thor.\"\n",
      "The big problems with Iron Man 3 are less specific to the movie itself than they are characteristic of the hypermalaise that's infected so many current mega-blockbusters.\n",
      "Far too much of this movie - like Tony's new toys - is running on remote control.\n",
      "The most interesting thing about Iron Man 3 isn't the movie itself, but the return of legendary screenwriter Shane Black.\n",
      "Shane Black's perfunctory, fatigued film will suffice for the fans who have to have their regular cinematic superhero fix, but will leave others generally unmoved.\n",
      "Just things blowing up, a great big endless boring noisy confusing nothingness given occasional zip by Gwyneth Paltrow in a temper.\n",
      "The third installment in the game-changing Iron Man trilogy takes all the hard work done by Marvel Studios in creating a rich, thoughtful but never po-faced cinematic universe, and turns it into a big joke.\n",
      "What can Hollywood do to save the genre? For starters, leave the city crushing to Godzilla and Michael Bay. If it can't fit in a comic book panel, it probably doesn't belong.\n",
      "So all of this critical foam about how The Winter Soldier is highly political with its internet leaks and whistleblowers is just the scum on the glass after a refreshing egg cream-a leftover, a thing to wash off.\n",
      "As much as I sat amused (occasionally highly amused) for 136 minutes, I never felt particularly engrossed or even all that thrilled. The stakes were too low.\n",
      "Unfortunately, with so many internal commitments to the franchise, this isn't a Captain America movie as much as a slice of Marvel pie in which Steve appears.\n",
      "I will pay $50 to anyone who can prove that one single audience member worldwide texted \"OMG, this plot is fantastic!\" at any point during or after the movie.\n",
      "A substantial disappointment after 2011's better-than-expected Captain America: The First Avenger...\n",
      "If only the film's level of visual creativity could have been applied to the story, it might feel like a standalone success instead of merely another link in the chain.\n",
      "The movie doesn't use any time in establishing an identity, because it is obsessed with the thrill.\n",
      "Yet another super-sized serving of superhero cinematic sponge cake... this follow-up really feels like bloated franchise filler.\n",
      "It takes a Captain America - level super bladder to make it through the film.\n",
      "There's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff.\n",
      "The conspiracy plays out like the screenwriters read The Huffington Post after The PATRIOT Act but didn't know that TV's \"Person of Interest\" was already doing this.\n",
      "Fans of this franchise should expect more than a boilerplate action flick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre.\n",
      "There are too many complicated relationships and back stories of which to keep track.\n",
      "Like many others of its type, [it] gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up.\n",
      "A breathless mix of pointless plot twists, fight scenes filmed badly, and teasers for future projects that felt less like watching a movie than having one explained to you.\n",
      "Unless you're intimately familiar with the so-called Marvel universe (or you really love CG explosions), little of this will resonate.\n",
      "\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible.\n",
      "On paper this sequel has some promising elements, but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises, and on a shelf next to \"Captain America: The First Avenger,\" \"The Winter Soldier\" is pale.\n",
      "The signal-to-noise ratio on \"The Winter Soldier\" is all messed up, and the net effect is self-canceling. I enjoyed the movie while I was watching it, or I thought I did, but all that's left is an irritating buzz.\n",
      "Sometimes the Marvel universe isn't as Marvelous as we've come to expect. Might have been more enjoyable if there had been a compelling story to go along with all the sound and fury ... Nick Fury.\n",
      "\"Captain America\" is everything a big budget superhero film should be - except inspired.\n",
      "Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered.\n",
      "Deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable ...\n",
      "At almost two-and-a-half hours, it's easily an hour too long...Too much of the first two hours, unfortunately, is dedicated to action scenes that are merely gunplay.\n",
      "I'm not saying that Captain America 2 is crap. But I don't see how anyone can claim that it is much better than a Very Special Episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n",
      "Chris Evans' welcome return to the superhero fold can't save this sequel from feeling like an awkward franchise mid-point.\n",
      "Exactly what we expect from Marvel now and, as such, this is the first film in its catalogue that doesn't feel particularly fresh or exciting.\n",
      "You can't help but feel disappointment that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse.\n",
      "Given the type of tight storytelling we are used to from Marvel, Guardians feels like it could have used a little tweaking, both narratively and character-wise.\n",
      "A film about misfit heroes is right on time after the A-group's gloss has begun to wane.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy might look like just the ticket. . . but allow me to save you time, money and the potential of getting stuck on the SkyTrain when it breaks down again. It's a pretender to the throne.\n",
      "Perhaps it was too much to hope for a smart, cartoony and slightly parodic space romp, instead of this, a more standard-issue Marvel superhero offering\n",
      "The big-screen debut of this underdog crew of ragtag Avengers tries a little too hard to fit in with its competition, rather than stand out.\n",
      "Junk, and proud of it\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy exists solely to advertise its own as-yet-unmade sequels.\n",
      "The lightly derisive, live-action-cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty, even of the comic-book type, and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity.\n",
      "These meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.\n",
      "The film begins to stumble, then, once the focus shifts to a narrative that's almost distractingly convoluted...\n",
      "... retro space opera plays more like a bad spoof of a 'Star Wars' spoof ‒ and even then it's closer to 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' than 'Spaceballs.'\n",
      "Outre, cheerful, yes... but wake me up when the Doctor Strange movie is ready.\n",
      "Gunn's listless adventure through space is not as uproarious as the Iron Man series, as thrilling as the Spider-Man franchise, or as dramatically serious as Nolan's Batman trilogy.\n",
      "\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology. Call it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand.\n",
      "This movie lacks the charm and genre affection that Galaxy Quest provided in buckets.\n",
      "It's like the silly, superhero-loving kids goofing off in the back of the classroom looked at The Avengers and X-Men and declared, \"Hey, how hard can it be to save the world? Let's do it too!\"\n",
      "There's a strong, likeable start to Guardians of the Galaxy, but from there, the movie begins a persistent slide into anonymity.\n",
      "In place of wit, \"Guardians\" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it.\n",
      "The very empty-headedness...will probably insure its enormous success, since many in the audience will be able to identify with it.\n",
      "I didn't enjoy it enough that I will ever want to sit through it again.\n",
      "\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are \"Howard the Duck\" and \"Green Lantern.\"\n",
      "The script has its moments but it lacks the unadulterated sense of fun that was so integral to many of the earlier Marvel movies.\n",
      "...so stuffed with pop-culture references that if you removed them the entire movie would likely collapse.\n",
      "Marvel puts its heart on its sleeve with a story about the healing power of friendship, but that sleeve is stained with blood, spit, and other bodily fluids.\n",
      "Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made.\n",
      "By the end, you'll have been winked at so much you may think you've been staring at a strobe light for nearly two hours.\n",
      "The film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects.\n",
      "I predict fans will eat this up, but I was hoping for something more accessible.\n",
      "A mixed bag leaning towards the negative.\n",
      "Women of color are either sexual objects or played off for laughs. Mantis, found by Ego and raised as his servant and 'pet', seems to be written explicitly for the film to indulge in submissive Asian stereotypes.\n",
      "This is drippy family therapy that wants you to bask in the characters' personal breakthroughs after you're done dissing them behind their backs.\n",
      "More of the same, and yet a case of diminishing returns.\n",
      "I enjoyed the humor when it landed, but the build-up was choppy, and the execution as a whole was choppy. The movie felt rushed.\n",
      "This new film is plenty entertaining, but lacks the complexity of its predecessor. For a movie that's about growth and relationships, it still feels like this sequel has a bit of growing up to do.\n",
      "The film, like its likeable heroes, struggles to find its own sense of significance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and its titular saved \"galaxy\" is left with little gravity or sense of place.\n",
      "The film is quite entertaining but becomes absurd because of the attitude of its characters making them unidimensional and causing the audience to lose interest in their conflicts. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a slapdash extravaganza careening though bluster and banality.\n",
      "There is certainly plenty of fun to be had with James Gunn's new entry in the Guardians universe, and I will look forward to more adventures with this group...but Volume 2 didn't quite hit the right note for me.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a candy-coated cinematic shot of sugar. It'll provide a short [high but] is ultimately unfulfilling.\n",
      "the jokes and throw-away gags and irreverent potshots at popular culture and action movie clichés and hero fantasies that felt so smooth and natural the first time around here feel more forced\n",
      "Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.\n",
      "Starts off much like the original, but goes off the rails in the third act. No Marvel movie to date has gone this far south this fast. (Splice Today)\n",
      "Disney and Marvel haven't learned that less is more. Instead they subscribe to The Lego Movie mentality that \"everything is awesome,\" no matter what.\n",
      "After watching all that jaunty kidcom adventure stuff, I kept getting the feeling that there was a '70's after-school special locked up inside this movie and struggling mightily to get out.\n",
      "Feels like a parody of Guardians of the Galaxy.\n",
      "Why should every manner of director hanker to make movies that are \"character-driven\"? What a terrible phrase that is! It makes drama feel like heavy labor.\n",
      "Gunn's script works overtime to repeat the crazy fun of the first part, but the plot lines in Vol 2 are clumsily manufactured.\n",
      "What doesn't work, alas, are the big things: the main story involving Peter and his real space dad, played by Kurt Russell, and the romantic \"unspoken thing\" between Peter and Gamora.\n",
      "Overall, though, Vol 2 suffers from blockbuster bloat. Hopefully the next installment, hinted at plentifully in the end credits, will recapture the fun-fuelled zing of the original.\n",
      "How many times is it funny or unexpected to score an action/sci-fi set piece with an incongruent '70s pop song? In the first film, it was a novelty, but nothing kills novelty like monotony.\n",
      "Here's hoping the inevitable Vol. 3 rebuilds some of the first film's heart, because Vol. 2 feels like hollow spectacle, however gorgeously rendered.\n",
      "... a functional enterprise that seems content more to repeat the accomplishments of its predecessor rather than to branch out in ambitious new directions.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the first MCU film to talk down to its audience.\n",
      "More of the same feels like less.\n",
      "There's a thin line between just enough and too much, and \"Guardians Vol. 2\" trips over that line and never gets back up.\n",
      "Often loud, occasionally obnoxious and so consistently convinced of its own awesomeness that it will not, it cannot, stop pointing out everything that makes it so utterly wonderful.\n",
      "It hurtles past at dizzying speed with a slew of new characters, soap opera-like motivations and confrontations, and goofy-ridiculous adventures, tasking audiences to keep up with it all.\n",
      "...insists on trying to wear big-boy blockbuster pants.\n",
      "It's overwrought and overlong. Whereas the first Guardians soared, this one kind of lumbers toward the finish line.\n",
      "Worse than occasionally being a downer, Vol. 2 is something Guardians of the Galaxy never was: dull, often for long stretches.\n",
      "Like \"Let's Twist Again,\" it can't play the same familiar chords with lesser lyrics and expect the same results. It isn't quite the revved-up rallying call for outcasts that the first one was, so this sequel is best approached with lower expectations.\n",
      "It's dispiriting to settle down for a Guardians of the Galaxy picture only to find you're watching Field of Dreams with added asteroids.\n",
      "\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\n",
      "Mildly enjoyable while instantly forgettable ...\n",
      "Watching it is akin to the experience of being trapped in a room with a Golden Retriever that is repeatedly licking you in the face. You'll emerge slightly happy, somewhat dazed, and covered in slobber.\n",
      "Quill's family-versus-friends dilemma aspires to The Empire Strikes Back, but though the tin ear dialogue is certainly Lucas-esque, Vol. 2's thematic reach far extends its grasp.\n",
      "The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film's emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It's heavy on the feels. There are hugs.\n",
      "The underdog panache of the original has ebbed, and now begins the tedious world-building and brand-building that becomes necessary when you make $700 million at the box office.\n",
      "Overstuffed...an elephantine sequel to a movie that was lighter on its feet; it tries so hard that the strain shows all too clearly.\n",
      "I suppose there's a kind of genius in Gunn's ability to remember what made him laugh in fourth grade, but if your sense of what's funny hasn't grown a tad more sophisticated since you were in primary school, then...\n",
      "Though individually and as a group the Guardians don't do anything they didn't do in the first film, \"Vol. 2's\" insistence on hitting everything twice as hard soon becomes wearing.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 probably couldn't, and definitely doesn't, recapture the sweet and singular silliness of the original, though the new edition from Marvel Studios and Disney has its rewards.\n",
      "It's a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "GOTG Vol.2 is very good at two things: laughing at its own perceived comic brilliance, and slo-mo sequences of characters walking forth to Fleetwood Mac or Cheap Trick.\n",
      "It coasts on the lazy assumption that references to 1980s video games can be the punchline to any joke.\n",
      "Much like its predecessor, Vol. 2 rests contentedly on its lush color palette and retro soundtrack to try and trick you into thinking you're not watching a Marvel movie.\n",
      "...aims to please with breathtaking set pieces that'll convince you to delete all your old diatribes about CGI ruining the movies. But... too many of the punch lines are referential; how much comedy can you milk from the mere mention of David Hasselhoff?\n",
      "The original Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014 had a freshness to its humour and introduced audiences to a set of novel characters; unfortunately, the sequel is overstuffed with ageing movie stars trying to get a slice of the action.\n",
      "It ends up standing alongside Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron as another example of the Marvel sophomore slump.\n",
      "Thinks it's edgy and transgressive, the punk little brother of all those other stodgy comic-book movies, but it isn't. It's just slightly more candy-colored.\n",
      "When Guardians of the Galaxy launched in 2014, it was a pure blast; the antithesis to the morose Batman. Now, it is effectively a wake in a candy shop, where nobody knows if they should be crying or getting giddy on sweets.\n",
      "This is the film equivalent of when your uncle walks into the room with a Sonic Youth t-shirt on, and then under bemused interrogation, he admits to having no idea they were even a band - he just likes the design.\n",
      "The vibe is corporate, and of the most depressing kind: It's not enough that you've paid for this product. You have to sit through commercials for the next one and the next and the next.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes at us grinning from ear-to-ear for nearly two and a half hours. It's high on its own supply.\n",
      "For the sequel, writer-director James Gunn has doubled down on all his once-nifty novelties. Strip them away and what remains is a bloated semi-mess.\n",
      "At its worst, it comes across like a vulgar birthday party hosted by an indulgent billionaire for a hard-to-please stepchild\n",
      "Like a number of Marvel \"part 2\" entries, it suffers from the push-pull between being a smaller, more character-driven sequel and providing the required mega-bucks action and spectacle.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\n",
      "Compared to its predecessor, Guardians 2 has a hollow emotional core, and the plotting feels clumsy. This movie doesn't have any real purpose, even as a bridge to other chapters in the Marvel story.\n",
      "Even the things people liked about the first movie get exaggerated until it's not cute anymore. Since everyone loved the blacklight joke, there are now constant sex jokes. Everyone loved Baby Groot in one scene, so now he's in the whole movie.\n",
      "It was almost inevitable that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would one day bite off more than it can chew.\n",
      "The Avengers don't seem cohesive, and we have weird attempts at character development.\n",
      "By far the worst movie in the MCU. Also, Why must Ultron have lips?\n",
      "Age of Ultron goes big - big cast, worldwide destruction, giant robot army - but in the end, it feels like very little happened.\n",
      "There so many plots in this movie and so many scene that are JUST there to set up future movies...It moves too fast.\n",
      "Hardcore fans will find enough to enjoy here, but I found the pace at times slow, the visual effects somewhat disappointing (particularly compared to The Winter Soldier) and the story less than engrossing.\n",
      "At 141 minutes, the sequel is almost even in length with the original, so why does it feel so much longer?\n",
      "This blockbuster sequel has a plot more convoluted than the Biblical begats. Knowing that the New Yorker critic Anthony Lane was stumped as well makes me feel slightly better. But it didn't make the movie-going experience any more enjoyable.\n",
      "It really, really feels like the 11th exhausting film in the unstoppable ring cycle of movies based on the Avengers comic-book heroes -- a vast and increasingly dull series of blockbusters planned out, terrifyingly, as far ahead as 2019.\n",
      "It's as entertaining as holiday fireworks: initially exciting, which fades; then just loud, and finally the sense of time wasted because everything you just watched was pretty, but utterly meaningless.\n",
      "Whedon has already announced that he won't be on board for the next installment, and you can hardly blame him. These films don't require a director. All they need are bean counters.\n",
      "It's not just bad, it's disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Loud, fluffy, and rather unsatisfying.\n",
      "Director Joss Whedon takes a big stick to the over-stuffed piñata of Marvel Comics' characters and successfully empties out all the candy, but leaves a landscape strewn with plastic wrappers and the promise of a pounding headache\n",
      "pointless\n",
      "Incredibly expensive action scenes full of destruction go on for way too long with little context behind them, leading to overkill and boredom.\n",
      "There's something to be had here, with such fine actors and seamless interlacing into a mega fantasy world, but overall the embarrassment of riches doesn't quite pay dividends.\n",
      "Avengers: Age of Ultron firmly confirms its place as the nadir of the Marvel cinematic universe - which is no small feat, certainly, given that the studio's output has been almost uniformly terrible.\n",
      "The movie is stiff and enervated. It's all punch-punch, banter-banter, like a sitcom in which cities get leveled.\n",
      "Whedon is pretty much locked into an overarching storyline and a bland house style here, so instead of bucking the system, he dutifully serves up more of the same bubble-brained gibberish and wanton destruction.\n",
      "The latest \"Avengers\" movie plays its music loud from start to finish. Mindless action rules, punctuated only by super hero/villain quips.\n",
      "That sound you hear is the bubble getting near to bursting.\n",
      "Feels like a bunch of those scenes Marvel usually reserves for the credits. It's more concerned about future films than the one it is actually in.\n",
      "Avengers: Age of Ultron is the sequel of a profitable Marvel franchise, but it's far less interesting and powerful than the first instalment.\n",
      "It's too big. It's too frenzied. It's too full of characters it can't contain. Mostly, it's just too much everything.\n",
      "A thoroughly competent movie, sure; but its competence is so routine and mechanical as to leave the thing overwhelmingly dull.\n",
      "More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.\n",
      "...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.\n",
      "We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and ‒ upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex ‒ can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.\n",
      "Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.\n",
      "Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.\n",
      "At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.\n",
      "Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.\n",
      "World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.\n",
      "Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.\n",
      "Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly\n",
      "The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.\n",
      "The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to expectations. [full review in Spanish]\n",
      "I began to forget the breathless, teetering, tottering, careening, catapulting Avengers: The Age Of Ultron about 20 minutes into its 141 minutes... Zoom, quip, wham, smirk, quip, blam! Quip! Oh so much too-muchness on an inhumane scale.\n",
      "It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?\n",
      "The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore.\n",
      "[The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters.\n",
      "When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?\n",
      "Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.\n",
      "That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that \"Ultron\" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder.\n",
      "More of the same, just not as good--lots of sound and fury (along with some Fury) signifying very little.\n",
      "A whole bunch of blather leads up to the same old climax with imperiled innocents and massive destruction.\n",
      "...the film starts out attempting to question the Avengers' place in the world and whether they really make a difference, only to forget to probe for an answer not long after the asking.\n",
      "There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going.\n",
      "Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him.\n",
      "Black Widow chooses the Hulk over Thor? Females everywhere say \"Huh?\" The Avengers show absolutely no interest in each other. AGE OF ULTRON is soulless.\n",
      "Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length.\n",
      "Darker than its predecessor [and] far less witty ... Whereas Stark seemed to dominate the first film, here the emphasis is ... Hawkeye and Black Widow ... a negative in the case of Hawkeye and a huge positive in the case of Black Widow.\n",
      "Ultron is too full, of action and CGI, while also being nearly empty of genuine thrills. A talented cast impresses throughout, but the action ultimately overwhelms it.\n",
      "\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" is supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real.\n",
      "An inferior sequel that brings little joy to its grandiosity, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" carries the vague aroma of uninspired, box-checking functionality.\n",
      "Enough fight scenes and action sequences for three Marvel movies, but they are rather nondescript.\n",
      "Spectacularly overstuffed - it's more spectacle than substance.\n",
      "Writing and directing \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own: mediocrity.\n",
      "Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems.\n",
      "Joss Whedon sets up the future of the Avengers for the Russo Brothers, but this is no longer exciting. It's exhausting.\n",
      "Sure, this is the A Team of comic book superstars, but overextended sequences don't make them any more impressive.\n",
      "Age of Ultron, then, shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedon's imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth).\n",
      "Thin on story, crowded with characters and padded with extraneous action. In other words, a sure hit!\n",
      "Ultron maintains Marvel's record for solid, entertaining blockbusters but falls down a bit in the \"making sense\" department.\n",
      "Most of these characters are great fun, and there are still stories to tell. So why not do it, instead of telling and retelling the same tale, only bigger?\n",
      "A lot of movie, where not a lot is special.\n",
      "The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point.\n",
      "Its problems may not have been so evident if it wasn't trying so hard to surpass the far better movies that preceded it.\n",
      "At times it feels like it's a few handfuls of terrific actors away from being a 'Transformers' entry.\n",
      "First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn't worth the sweat.\n",
      "Having bent the world to his will, Whedon, a modest and self-deprecating talent, has helped Marvel unleash a form of spectacle-laden blockbuster that, unfortunately, seems intent on obliterating what he does best.\n",
      "141 minutes of noise and incident.\n",
      "It was like Whedon thought about the 1st film and felt it wasn't deep enough, not realizing that its success was its comic book shallowness. It was just fun for audiences.\n",
      "When movies such as this come along which feel more like financial investments than stories, that's what you get: production line filmmaking in which human beings are incidental and even unnecessary in the face of computer-generated scale and spectacle.\n",
      "Like a magnificent cake sliced into too many slivers, the movie is at once too much and never quite enough.\n",
      "Any true drama is entirely missing. There is no tension. Everything has to stop for the next battle. It is tediously repetitive. And the characters are all one defining trait.\n",
      "The film-makers' understandable inability to take their own material seriously has now pushed the project beyond gentle parody and into broad pastiche.\n",
      "The movie's action sequences and sequel-baiting suck up much of its oxygen, and the magnitude of battles dwarf the smaller moments.\n",
      "In many ways, Marvel has grown up and passed Whedon by - and his jocular take on the material doesn't just feel stale, it feels like a step back.\n",
      "A $250 million pile of poo.\n",
      "Avengers: Age of Ultron, is a letdown -- entertaining to a degree, but so overstuffed that it may mark the point of diminishing returns for the Marvel movies generally.\n",
      "While the visuals are extraordinary and the wry humour is welcome, what's missing is a coherent story with light and shade\n",
      "It's hard to muster the attention span to care about Earth's Mightiest Heroes when we know they'll just be back to do it all again in a few years.\n",
      "Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do.\n",
      "It looks great, but haven't we been here before?\n",
      "If you're happy to, as they say, just turn your brain off and watch your heroes fight, it's fine...But Marvel has set me up to expect stories a bit above that base level\n",
      "[Marvel keeps creating] excellent female characters, then com[ing] up with reasons why they cannot be the primary protagonist.\n",
      "By the sweet hammer of Thor, Marvel Comics has really, really run out of ideas this time.\n",
      "So Ant-Man is an admirable but flawed attempt to expand the Marvel canon. The script is far from Marvel's best and, considering the film aims to be light hearted, lacks the laughs that bolster so many of these films.\n",
      "The same tepid, timeworn routine with a few chocolate sprinkles of 'fun' on top. ... Marvel has become its own antonym.\n",
      "No other Marvel installment has felt as weighed down by its obligations to the franchise.\n",
      "[Ants are] pests, and that's just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins.\n",
      "The weakest Marvel movie since The Incredible Hulk.\n",
      "...it's becoming more and more apparent that Marvel simply has no idea what they're doing within the blockbuster genre.\n",
      "...fails to have enough fun with its one unique element: the sense of scale.\n",
      "Ant-Man symbolises American accomplishment. It is about people transcending the physical limitations of the human body and it is also a comedy variation on the political idea that the smallest person can change the world.\n",
      "At long last Marvel Studios offers up a superhero smaller than its artistic ambitions.\n",
      "To say the least, this is a movie with a few bugs in it.\n",
      "Neither exciting action movie nor exuberantly silly comedy in the vein of Guardians, Ant-Man is mildly amusing but frankly a little dull; essential viewing only for Marvel completists ...\n",
      "Not so f-ant-astic, then, just a little ant-iclimatic.\n",
      "It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened.\n",
      "It's certainly competent and amusing when need be, but not much more than that.\n",
      "Ant-Man has all the right parts, but in Ultron's wake and at the forefront of a long upcoming lineup of films, it really is time for Marvel to start doing better.\n",
      "Ant-Man just isn't that great an idea and the film exists only because the Marvel machine is working so remorselessly through its massive back catalogue.\n",
      "The film isn't terrible but it makes earlier Marvel outings look like masterpieces. There's hardly a trope in it you haven't seen before, and done with far greater flair. It feels like making a mountain out of an anthill.\n",
      "A fairly straightforward, conventional superhero story, where a mere mortal gathers the ability to be extraordinary and then becomes a hero. This is no way to sell me on a story about a guy who can make himself the size of an ant.\n",
      "'Ant-Man' will appeal mostly to ant-people. Translated: children. Factor in fans of Paul Rudd and Marvel superheroes, and you could have a box office community picnic.\n",
      "There's a decent amount of fun to be had... But considering Marvel's stellar track record and the comedic wonderfulness of its star, Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is more than a little disappointing.\n",
      "The result is a film not quite sure of itself, like it's wearing clothes a size too big.\n",
      "The attempts at overt comedy are hit-and-miss. The heist elements are derivative and not nearly as inventive as one might expect given the possibilities. The action sequences are variable and the dramatic moments... the less said, the better.\n",
      "Ant-Man doesn't even try to break the mold, but at least it's less busy and bombastic than most Marvel offerings.\n",
      "Why, oh why, must these movies telling the story of the beginnings of a superhero do the same things over and over and over again?\n",
      "Pretending there's a more fascinating version of this film out there somewhere, like the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, is a great way to come to terms with how rote and unremarkable Ant-Man is.\n",
      "It's a film that always feels this close to being unique, and funny, and thrilling. Which is why when it misses its mark, over and over and over again, the sound of its failure resounds that much louder.\n",
      "A film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality.\n",
      "This acceptably diverting superhero outing keeps threatening to break free and become something special, but in the end, there's just too much at stake. And that's a shame, especially for Paul Rudd fans.\n",
      "We start with carefree exhilaration. ... But - wages of bingemanship - we then proceed to boorish silliness and finally stupor.\n",
      "Director Peyton Reed tries to piece it together but there's just no way to make the scenes with Rudd seem like anything more than a rejected Saturday Night Live skit.\n",
      "Yawn.\n",
      "The movie's almost self-deprecatory sense of tongue-in-cheek humility is matched by the fact that all the pleasures it affords are very small indeed.\n",
      "A movie that feels like it came off an assembly line, which makes it that much stranger when it keeps attempting comedy. Aw, look, the widget has jokes!\n",
      "When your most memorable character turns out to be Thomas the Tank Engine, featured in two hilarious scenes, you know your picture about a tiny superhero has big, big problems.\n",
      "Certainly someone with more action experience could do justice to the character's flexibility and sense of honor. In Reed's hands, \"Ant-Man\" feels about as small as its main character.\n",
      "Ant-Man isn't so much watching, as living through Weekend At Bernie's. Peyton Reed and co. come and parade the soulless and lifeless corpse of an Edgar Wright film.\n",
      "Ant-Man cares more about setting up the future than addressing the present, and for that, Paul Rudd's best efforts as the wise-cracking insect companion are overshadowed by what's to come.\n",
      "If you can hang in there an hour and a half, this latest Marvel installment does, finally, deliver. But why do we have to wait so long?\n",
      "Ant-Man emerges only as a minor hero - fine for occasional gags and cameos in upcoming Marvel ensembles, but undeserving of all this attention. And his movie feels, not like a well-deserved launch, but a contractual obligation ...\n",
      "Half-assed mentions of the Avengers, as well as a few cameo appearances sprinkled both within the feature and in its credits stingers, exude less shame than a crowd-pandering politico.\n",
      "The narrative is leaden and lumpy in a way that suggests prolonged script-tinkering.\n",
      "The comedy is muted, the action scenes are slick but forgettable and the character's USP is largely wasted.\n",
      "The Ant-Man movie is nonstop exposition up until the third act, so about 90 minutes. What fan of anything would want a whole movie explaining how it works? You want to see it in action, not spend the whole movie trying to convince nonbelievers.\n",
      "Even with such a weird concept about a guy who can shrink and then communicate with ants ... there's way too much that feels familiar here.\n",
      "As generic as comic-book movies come.\n",
      "You can see, especially in that final, hilarious mêlée scene, where Ant-Man could have gone right. (Where it could have gone Wright?) But the film is too timid to fully take the wilder turns, to become its own distinct creature.\n",
      "Watching it is like channel-surfing between Hot Fuzz, a duff early 90s Michael Douglas drama and the very schlockiest bits of Interstellar.\n",
      "Even the jokes that do work leave some laughs on the table, and the impulse to play things safe proves emblematic of a film that shrinks in the face of a challenge.\n",
      "Serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill.\n",
      "There's no sensitivity, no eye for movement, no feeling for the way a camera can create emotion out of nothing, no heart beating beneath its celluloid skin.\n",
      "Jokey rather than funny, and a bit forced when it's trying to be sincere, Ant-Man has plenty of enthusiasm but not a lot of inspiration, Reed unable to conceive the film in such a way that it establishes its own niche in the big-screen Marvel landscape.\n",
      "Marvel is playing it safe and its themes of vengeance never see a real consequence. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Overall, the lack of ingenuity makes for a lackluster story in need of major content editing.\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War is very much a sequel to Winter Soldier but, regrettably, too long, tryingly complicated and it takes the best part of 75 minutes before it breaks into anything resembling comic exuberance.\n",
      "Actually, instead of Captain America: Civil War, a more appropriate title might be Captain America: Cap and Iron Man Get Their Iddy-Biddy Feewings Hurt.\n",
      "Never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross, if the acting is terrible, the costumes are hideous, if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat, loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced.\n",
      "It's more of the same, of course it has a little more entertainment, but it's the same tendency to repeat what has worked in the past, nothing new. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Anthony and Joe Russo make a cheerful show of it, giving their gee-whiz comic book audience all they could wish for -- and more. But that's the problem -- it's still just 90 minutes worth of story stretched out to two-and-a-half hours.\n",
      "The fact that Civil War ponders the importance of those who've died in conflicts doesn't add complexity to the film, it just fills it with hipocrisy. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Captain America and Iron Man almost represent the schism that now divides American voters, politicians, and pundits. I say \"almost,\" because the film...doesn't inspire reflection upon the dire seriousness of our current ideological civil war.\n",
      "The motto of the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, appears to be: If you can make it happen, do it. Don't hold back.\n",
      "An underwhelming exercise in sound and fury striclty for brains on pause. .\n",
      "Dull, overlong, exhausting and mildly entertaining without rising to the heights of the first Captain America's palpable thrills, suspense and intrigue\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War is the movie equivalent of the all-dressed potato chip: A junk food classic that can't be denied, but can never truly satisfy our desire for something original.\n",
      "Slid off my senses like Thor's hammer across Cap's vibranium shield -- the powerhouse hits land without so much as a scratch.\n",
      "The sad middle-aged dudes who cling so desperately to these films require constant reassurances that they're not just fun stories for children in which men wear tights.\n",
      "Listening to the applause of cheers for deaths and devastation was a bit scary and more and more what we are seeing in real life. No wonder why!\n",
      "This is a stark example of what movies have become, which is intellectual diarrhea...there is no acting...just one ridiculous fight after another between and among people who are more or less invulnerable. But, get used to it. This junk makes money.\n",
      "...just another loud, overblown Marvel misfire...\n",
      "Civil War makes a pretense of pondering the consequences of going rogue. But Marvel is all about playing it safe.\n",
      "Mostly, this one registers as sound and fury, signifying sequels.\n",
      "After the first two \"Captain America\" entries, the finest comic-book movies of the last five years, this one is disappointing.\n",
      "Big, Bigger and Biggest doesn't equal Best in this Captain America chapter of the Avengers movie chronicle.\n",
      "a boldly efficient house of cards\n",
      "Much of \"Captain America: Civil War\" is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" two summers ago.\n",
      "Despite its technical polish, it comes across more as just another assembly-line commercial product than the special event that fans are no doubt hoping for.\n",
      "It's just stultifyingly dutiful.\n",
      "Ponderous pandering. And no Paltrow as Pepper Potts?\n",
      "The undeniable fun of the action scenes only exacerbates the failure of the narrative to adequately contend with its own themes.\n",
      "The latest Captain America adventure us nothing more than a really long trailer for the new adventures of the new Spider-Man. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Bragging just a bit - see how many franchise characters we've got, DC? - Marvel practically doubles the number of superheroes for this movie. And it's too much.\n",
      "There's some good stuff in 'Captain America: Civil War.' That's what these Marvel things are now: a lot of stuff.\n",
      "One of Marvel's rare missteps, lacking the joy, excitement and sense of anything being possible that's always been the studio's hallmark.\n",
      "It all feels shudderingly hollow; a stack of briefs filled to a fault by a pair of journeyman directors.\n",
      "Look, I don't begrudge those who love the Avengers, as they so passionately do. I'm just genuinely perplexed.\n",
      "The political allegories are mostly abandoned and swapped for character motivation, as if we should never have bothered to contemplate a second meaning in the first place.\n",
      "This movie is so toothless that you'll probably pay for your ticket in a paper cup on the side of the road... it's so concerned with keeping everything in line for future movies that it ultimately takes no risks...\n",
      "Diehard fans will likely find Easter eggs and winking references to Marvel Comics and MCU content to pore over, but other moviegoers should be able to call this stultifying slog what it is: a terrible film and a waste of a good cast.\n",
      "Black Widow represents the MCU looking back when it should be moving forward. Everything about the movie seems small, even the big action set-pieces\n",
      "An inert show, excessively generic, and that leaves an unpleasant sensation of \"more of the same\" on the palate.\n",
      "Romanoff's positioning against a flagrant misogynist, combined again with the delayed timing of her long-awaited solo film, may feel dangerously close to tokenism.\n",
      "This celebration of the nuclear family - a completely phoney nuclear family - is relentless. They're killers but also big softies, who look back nostalgically on those happy days spent undercover in Ohio.\n",
      "Black Widow is a dumb movie that recycles the same Russophobic Cold War narrative Hollywood has been using for years. But it's just dopey enough and supplies just enough laughs that I couldn't be mad at it.\n",
      "More women is its only decent idea. Otherwise, it's business as usual. Otherwise, it's all formulaic bish-bosh, smash-crash action scenes broken up by lame jokes and lame philosophising along the lines of: \"Your pain only makes you stronger.\"\n",
      "Director Cate Shortland has said the goal for Black Widow was to make it gritty, grounded, and real. She should have aimed for engaging, entertaining, and comprehensible.\n",
      "It suggests to me that there was never a real grasp on what this film was supposed to be.\n",
      "Packed with hollow action scenes that don't hurt to watch, nor do they offer surprises or delights.\n",
      "It's a fun espionage thriller and Florence Pugh is a marvel. But didn't it also feel extremely phoned in?\n",
      "There's little wit in the writing or cleverness in the storytelling, which features a dull conflict as well as a vacuous, ill-considered villain.\n",
      "It should come as no surprise that a film churned out by the biggest entertainment conglomerate on earth, is in fact a de facto apologia for American exceptionalism.\n",
      "It is one of the worst MCU films I have ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "It's as if someone ripped out the movie's uterus.\n",
      "There is surprisingly little girl-power rhetoric here, as if the film itself was weary of years of female superheroes discourse.\n",
      "To ensure that all of our behemoth pop culture franchises become one indistinguishable mass of content, the MCU is now faster and furious-er...\n",
      "This Black Widow is supposed to be the opening chapter of a new phase for the MCU. It's a rocky start...\n",
      "Finally Natasha R. can have her own movie. But it's a few years too late and chock full of superficial characters, eye rolling suspension of disbelief (rest easy F9), and forced humor.\n",
      "The best scene in the movie, obviously designed to peek into Marvel's cinematic future, comes at the very end of the ever-lengthy, final-credits process. Surely diehard Avengers fanatics likely already know everything about it.\n",
      "Combining \"The Americans\" with \"Salt,\" the otherwise erratic plot boils down to if Paige Jennings grew up to become Evelyn Salt.\n",
      "\"Black Widow\" never feels more than just a footnote in the story, a detour that holds no weight in the larger M.C.U. narrative, except to set up Yelena for a larger role in the future.\n",
      "Loud, clumsy and cinematically desolate.\n",
      "It's a strange movie: front-loaded with its best action, its zippiest writing, its canniest pleasures, then derailed by exposition that only serves to let the air out of the room for being so obvious rather than deepening what's there.\n",
      "The film ceases to be about Natasha wrestling with her heroism; by pitting her against a raging misogynist, Black Widow tries to simplistically cast Natasha as a pop-feminist icon.\n",
      "Coming out more than a year after it was supposed to, it feels like an awkward reminder of what Marvel failed to do early on in its run, but occasionally, mostly whenever Pugh is in control, it's a thrilling preview of what's to come.\n",
      "It suggests a bright future for Pugh's Yelena, but, ironically, does the bare minimum in finally giving Natasha Romanoff her due.\n",
      "...the issues with Black Widow go beyond the past and its ill-timed release. Marvel waited too long to tell Natasha's story, but it's also proved unfit to do so.\n",
      "Johansson and co-star Florence Pugh are terrific, but the lightweight story relies on implausible plot turns and cheap soap opera antics.\n",
      "I wish the story felt like it had more traction, more sense of purpose, rather than being a side-story shoehorned in between more powerful tales.\n",
      "A bigger reason for the film coming up so short in quality is that the title character ends up being the least interesting of all the players.\n",
      "[Black Widow is] not the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, but it is easily one of the blandest.\n",
      "Dishearteningly less concerned with giving Natasha Romanoff her own story than with setting up her MCU replacement. Superfluous, backward-looking, its bit of feminism belabored. She deserved better.\n",
      "Black Widow wants to give MCU fans the reward of understanding a reference without asking them to do the work. This is diluted fandom.\n",
      "As talented as Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh are, nothing they do or say feels honest or character-driven.\n",
      "It's Scarlett Johansson's movie, but Florence Pugh steals the show. Adequate but the film never takes cinematic risks.\n",
      "The property that was supposed to be the first movie installment of \"Phase Four\" by now just feels phased out.\n",
      "Black Widow, much like the family at its core, is a messy affair. Although the action sequences are entertaining, the awkward dramatic beats hinder the overall flow of the film.\n",
      "Black Widow isn't much of an action movie -- it exists mostly to fill the narrative gap between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.\n",
      "[I]t's ultimately disappointing how much of Black Widow is, in its comparatively limited way, just more of the same.\n",
      "A sidebar to the overall Marvel project rather than an essential part of it, a mixture of spy story and superhero movie that, despite the charisma and chemistry of both Johansson and Pugh, comes across as less than the sum of its parts.\n",
      "Like pretty much every Marvel film, Black Widow is a polished and easy-to-watch blockbuster, but that's all it is, and it's tough to remember anything even remotely notable after the credits roll.\n",
      "Take out all the mindless bickering, pointless fight scenes, cutesy-poo Avengers references and tie-ins to future Disney+ TV series, and you're left with maybe 75 to 80 minutes of actual movie.\n",
      "The highlight is Pugh who steals the film from Johansson, supplying a sense of barbed humor as well as humanity to her character that's welcomed. A star is born amidst all this chaos.\n",
      "If the film delivered better action thrills or emotional oomph I wouldn't care to nit-pick about such things, but the mind starts to wander when it's underwhelmed.\n",
      "The pieces are great, but the execution leaves plenty to be desired.\n",
      "The film isn't likely to go down in Marvel history as much more than a footnote, nor does it tell us much about the studio's envisaged next phase.\n",
      "It's no small thing to bring together actors who have carried two of the most audacious films of the past decade (Johansson in Under the Skin, Pugh in Midsommar) but they deserve better than this material.\n",
      "Just as the comedy scenes aren't funny, the action scenes aren't thrilling. Natasha never seems as if she's in any danger. She never seems like she's having fun, either.\n",
      "Pugh and Harbour are a delight in the midst of a film that is nothing more than ordinary in yet another typical super hero film.\n",
      "Sadly quickly degenerates into a maddening mess of unnecessary scenes, mildly well-choreographed action, and a comic book megalomania that... is actually completely out of place here. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Especially as relates to its genre-specific weaknesses, Black Widow is all too familiar.\n",
      "A lethargic, clunky and overlong bore that's low on thrills, suspense and excitement.\n",
      "The film's truer purpose seems to serve as a set-up for the next Black Widow character - Pugh's Yelena Bolava - who'll be taking over the franchise, but that could've been done in many ways other than this approach.\n",
      "Black Widow doesn't even feel like any kind of final sendoff. Or a way to complete her story arc.\n",
      "Black Widow mixes great action with a tedious script, predictable plot and overly long runtime. The results are mixed.\n",
      "Love Florence Pugh. Love David Harbour. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a better Black Widow movie than the actual Black Widow movie.\n",
      "It's the cynicism that's depressing. After all, \"Black Widow\" is not an attempt at a good movie that failed. That would've been respectable. Rather, it's an attempt to make a piece of garbage commerce that succeeded completely.\n",
      "In trying to be a statement, rather than a film, it's managed to be very little of either.\n",
      "At the risk of being stoned as a heretic, I'd best describe this action-packed 'origin' saga as too many stunts in search of a cohesive story.\n",
      "This film could have been great. It could have been so much better than it is, but they just kind of made a contractual movie that feels like a placeholder for other things in the future.\n",
      "A weak script and low ambition make the movie crumble under the weight.\n",
      "Black Widow is the manifestation of the \"sunk cost fallacy\"--there oughta be support groups. Same as it ever was. Same as it ever was.\n",
      "Watching Black Widow play out, you feel a bit like a schoolteacher watching an underperforming student: Marvel, you're so much better than this.\n",
      "Natasha remains the paper-thin sketch of character she always was, relegated to a posthumous backdoor pilot of a sendoff, leaving us hoping they can get it right the next time.\n",
      "Out Bonding Bond, this solo superhero flick is no Wonder Woman.\n",
      "Scarlett Johansson can't muscle past generic storytelling in disappointing spinoff.\n",
      "After a strong first half, the movie gets derailed by its real villain: a poor, tonally off script. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Black Widow doesn't find the right way to tell one of [the MCU's] most serious stories to date\n",
      "After an entire year of no Marvel movies on the big screen, it's difficult not to recommend this as worthy escapist popcorn fun. But that's it\n",
      "Great girl power, and the family dynamics and dramatic scenes stand out, [but] the action and thriller bits blend together into an unmemorable montage.\n",
      "So focused on using disability and trauma as plot devices, the filmmakers never plumb the depths of what it is to lack agency.\n",
      "The years-too-late solo flick for Scarlett Johansson's MCU superhero is both too much of a glorified backdoor pilot for its co-star and not up to par with the spy films and espionage thrillers it wishes to emulate.\n",
      "\"Black Widow\" seems like a missed opportunity - an energetic placeholder in the Marvel Cinematic Universe meant to tide audiences over until a bigger, richer adventure comes along.\n",
      "[Black Widow's] story never reaches its full potential, especially with the lackluster villains.\n",
      "\"Black Widow\" simultaneously feels like too much and too little.\n",
      "Like the young Natasha herself, \"Black Widow\" feels as though it's been programmed into submission - and scarcely allowed to live and breathe before it's suddenly over.\n",
      "The stakes are nonexistent. No matter how many times a bad guy (or girl) aims a gun at our beloved heroine, we know she has a specific Endgame.\n",
      "Marvel returns to cinemas, and its first film back is a bit lackluster. This feels ten years too late, not just for the character but for this type of bland action film.\n",
      "Its lazy script reduces elements of trauma to empty dialogue ad awkward comedy. A disappointing Marvel movie that fails its fans and casting alike. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Boiled down to its essence, this narrative isn't terribly hard to follow, but in execution the film moves so haphazardly as to be bewildering.\n",
      "Black Widow falls victim to the big bombast characteristic of the studio. The result is a disappointing solo movie that ends up burying Natasha Romanoff once again.\n",
      "The universe of the Marvel studios can be easily followed, but it begins to get too close in itself, losing the naturalness of the independent stories. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Everything is derived. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a typical product of this annoyingly collaborative philosophy.\n",
      "Yup. Marvel actually made Sony release a whole movie about the hero of their \"their\" superhero franchise begging Robert Downey Jr. to please, pretty-please, let him be in more of the Avengers movies.\n",
      "If my mind wanders toward television, that's because \"Homecoming\" often feels like a 'roided-up pilot for a season's worth of tidy small-screen fare.\n",
      "There's plenty of fan fodder for Avengers lovers, but for those of us less Marvelously inclined, it feels more like a rollicking kids' feature.\n",
      "The problem is that this being the third cinematic attempt at Spidey, it's been overdone and it doesn't help Raimi produced the very peak of it in 2004.\n",
      "The action is plentiful, though not particularly memorable, and, sigh, a sequel has already been announced.\n",
      "Spidey Senses are set to snooze.\n",
      "A middling high school action-comedy with dull setpieces; a lesser \"Superbad\" with superhero cameos.\n",
      "While it is frequently enjoyably, it is also an overly managed and manufactured product, designed and refined to fit neatly into the Marvel Universe without causing any ripples.\n",
      "A strangely oblivious film, one that undercuts its story with exactly the sort of praise-hungriness that its hero learns to overcome.\n",
      "Sadly, the promising start soon falls flat, and we're left with an unmemorable attempt to replace Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, both of whose tales about the boy-superhero far surpass this one.\n",
      "Here we are again, watching the same thin plot told with great surface power, but little attention given to the great responsibility of keeping an audience surprised.\n",
      "The chorus of advance raves has declared that Watts has hit the sweet spot. I'd call it sweet-and-sour.\n",
      "It's Peter Parker Pastiche.\n",
      "An exercise in diminishment. Feels like like one of the smallest and most inconsequential Marvel films yet.\n",
      "It plays like a very long TV show and might even remind old-timers of the '50s-era \"Adventures of Superman.\" That's the laughable series in which no one ever recognized George Reeves after he showed up as Clark Kent as soon as his alter ego flew away.\n",
      "By partially demonstrating what a newer, fresher superhero movie might look like, Homecoming ultimately underlines its own genre-defined limitations.\n",
      "I really like Holland's effort to mix true-blue \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\" heroism with a teen boy's natural immaturity and awkwardness, but he needs a better movie.\n",
      "Aunt May seems to have discovered the Fountain of Youth. Rosemary Harris was 75 and Sally Field was 66. Marisa Tomei is 53. Aunt May will soon be younger than her nephew.\n",
      "A Spider-Man movie trapped in an Iron Man movie.\n",
      "The movie lacks inspiration; even the big \"twist\" is more worthy of a suppressed chuckle than a dropped jaw - it's like something pulled out of a bad soap opera.\n",
      "The movie breaks no new ground, and action sequences that were intended to be thrilling - such as an epic battle on the Staten Island Ferry - just sit there on the screen, incapable of stirring a single pulse, but content in their competence.\n",
      "Cute, nothing more.\n",
      "A little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming is better than Spider-Man 3 but not by much.\n",
      "By far the most lightweight and thematically inconsequential of any and all past \"Spider-Man\" features.\n",

      "The film is painfully average. It does so much in every area but actually tell a riveting story.\n",
      "It does nothing truly distinct from every other Marvel Studios offering, I will be first in line. If they think they can sucker me into paying for outdated special effects and a movie I have seen many times over, they have another thing coming.\n",

      "What's the problem? Well, there's way too much expository dialogue and there are too many turgid flashbacks...the hand-to-hand fighting and battle sequences are now so formulaic and predictable in Marvel films that the adrenaline just doesn't kick in.\n",
      "Expect to leave the theatre more exhausted than entertained.\n",

      "The plotting is predictable and the action sequences for the most part unengaging. Black Panther is a major disappointment.\n",
      "Dialogue heavy with a confused sense of place, this mega-budget Marvel marvel might be a misfire for anyone beyond the fan-base...\n",
      "Black Panther spirals into a stodgy tale of internecine feuding, in which T'Challa is required to come to terms with the sins of past generations. What he doesn't get to do much of is jump around beating-up bad guys. That's a shame.\n",
      "Riddled with the same sense of formula, small glimmers of substance glimmer through the usual predictable cadences bequeathed upon the budding superhero fast track.\n",
      "Benedict Cumberbatch's egotistical Ironman-meets-House-MD persona keeps us in the game - if only just. He shares more chemistry with his eccentric levitation cloak than with most humans in the film.\n",
      "Entre un protagónico que casi no convence, un villano de cartón, arcos argumentales insultantemente inconclusos y una batalla final anticlimática, Doctor Strange es una extraña decepción.\n",
      "Another package from the conveyer belt of prototypical superhero movies with crap CGI and a relentless cacophony of action sequences where nothing ever really feels at stake.\n",
      "It's handicapped by performances that are decent but not great, an over-abundance of visual effects that are state-of-the-art but far too familiar, and a storyline that just gets sillier the longer it goes on.\n",
      "The film is bloated and unfunny... and is plagued by a boringly retrograde notion of pan-Asian-ness while conveniently escaping the burden of casting any actual Asians in its principal roles.\n",
      "Strange is pretty much the same sort of movie we've seen from Marvel Studios ever since Robert Downey Jr. snarked his way through the first Iron Man and into our hearts all those years ago, and the same style of origin Marvel has been delivering since.\n",
      "[An] underwhelming panel-to-screen Marvel adaptation.\n",
      "Doctor Strange, intended to be a mind-bending, rule-breaking rebuke to the squares of superhero cinema, turns out to be a rebel in name only -- the textbook definition of a bad trip.\n",
      "Quite possibly the worst of the Marvel movies...\n",
      "My reaction to this movie is mixed, at best.\n",
      "With Dr. Strange the Marvel magic seems largely to have run out-which is unfortunate, given the movie's titular protagonist is himself a magician.\n",
      "A beat-for-beat remake of the first Iron Man movie crossed with a Windows 95 screensaver. Doesn't this stuff ever get stale to you people?\n",
      "\"Doctor Strange\" is where the welcome wears out, where Marvel's shortcomings take center stage and play a thousand encores.\n",
      "Dull, talky, derivative, full of the usual CGI cheez whiz. Cumberbatch is the epitome of vanilla.\n",
      "The filmmaking isn't bold enough to fully revel in the strangeness of the source material.\n",
      "Affluent white guy gets knocked down a peg or two, gets rebuked by his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) when he needs her support the most, has an epiphany at the hands of an (inexplicably white) eastern master, and re-emerges as a superhero: Doctor Peculiar.\n",
      "Basically Iron Man with weaker laugh lines and vastly cooler action sequences. It's Iron Man meets Thor 2, and the thing is, those guys have met before.\n",

      "Kevin Feige pulled on his hyper-blade express shoes and dashed for the room...\n",
      "For a long while Doctor Strange works both sides of the spiritual street with spectacular success. Then the film becomes what it was sending up so delightfully.\n",
      "Not strange enough; it has plenty of CGI magic effects, but lacks the cinematic magic that would set it apart from the other franchises in Marvel's increasingly crowded stable.\n",
      "Doctor Strange likes to think it's adding a new dimension to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in truth it's the same Marvel story from a slightly different perspective.\n",
      "No doubt there will be many who enjoy Doctor Strange simply because there's a plethora of action, but for those looking for the satisfying narrative foundation that these films are usually set upon, unfortunately you'll find it just a little lacking.\n",
      "None of it makes any sense, but logic is the last thing any of the minds attracted to this kind of junk want or expect.\n",
      "Those reality-warping effects offer a tantalizing glimpse at how superhero movies could embrace the visual wealth of comics. If only its story, a retread of Iron Man, was as creative as the action scenes.\n",
      "Like Strange's \"mirror-verse,\" where sorcerers cast spells...without impacting our physical realm, his comic-book vehicle delivers bursts of wonder with little lasting effect.\n",
      "Nobody is having much fun here. Well, except for Doctor Strange's devilish Cloak of Levitation.\n",
      "For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise.\n",
      "Ultimately, Doctor Strange isn't so much bad as it is difficult to justify.\n",
      "The strangest thing about [Marvel's] latest feature is that all of these characters come across utterly bored with their vocations.\n",
      "The film feels more programmed than written, more pre-visualised than directed.\n",
      "Perhaps it's just that there's a little too much Marvel Studios in Doctor Strange, when the strongest thing about the film are the filmmakers hired to bring it to life.\n",
      "Not even a sorcerer as powerful as Dr. Strange is able to break Marvel's spell, which continues with the same kind of villains and weak female counterparts. [Full review in Spanish]\n",

      "Busy with CGI to hide the emptiness where the emotional core should be. Even the mechanics of getting a man from mere mortal to demigod-in-a-cape are rote.\n",
      "The visuals are worth the price of admission, but this is as generic and by-the-numbers an origin story as the MCU has ever made. It's better than 'Green Lantern,' but it will remind you of 'Green Lantern'.\n",
      "Ends up a formulaic exercise.\n",
      "Audiences [will] get caught up in the laughter and absurdity, enjoying the ride without realizing how little is happening. Three years ago, I probably would have too.\n",
      "When I saw this film prefaced by a trailer for the far glossier-looking Black Panther, it slightly felt, once Thor: Ragnarok started, that we were being palmed off with an hors d'oeuvre for the next, bigger thing down the line.\n",
      "A minor improvement over the previous installment...\n",
      "Reality is something we readily put aside when watching a Marvel outing, but ...Thor: Ragnarok is little more than a grocery store genre cake: industrial formula and A-list talent enveloped in an unnatural green screen icing.\n",
      "Thor Ragnarok takes you on a visually psychedelic adventure that sadly goes absolutely nowhere.\n",
      "As undeniably enjoyable as it was, Thor: Ragnarok didn't feel like the latest installments of one of the MCU's central characters as much as it did a big budget spoof of a Marvel film.\n",
      "With its 130 minute script that has no clue where it's going, mixed with a mash-fest of 1980's fantasy/sci-fi films we've already seen, it is an intumescent mega mess.\n",

      "There's something just a little bit off about the way the film handles its title character.\n",
      "\"Ragnarok\" is supposed to play for laughs, but it feels like the joke is on the audience.\n",
      "[F]or all of its winking and joking, Thor: Ragnarok ultimately cannot escape the trap of established formula.\n",
      "Director Taika Waititi's take on the God of Thunder plays a bit like the rock mockumentary This is Spinal Tap: it's front-loaded with jokes, built around a severe humbling, and full of silly bombast.\n",
      "Ragnarok is a glorified commercial for next year's Avengers: Infinity War.\n",
      "The balance of humor and action has become so one-sided that Thor: Ragnarok could use a laugh track.\n",

      "About as inventive and original as one of these things can probably get away with being, before it has to go back to being the same old s--t.\n",
      "Superhero fans deserve better than this. Battles should have heart, danger, and consequences. The conflicts in Thor: Ragnarok are lacking in all three.\n",
      "You may find yourself longing for the days when superheroes played it straight.\n",
      "You'll watch, be lightly amused for two hours, and go back to forgetting that Thor exists.\n",
      "As much fun as it is, Ragnarok, by treating everything as an opportunity for a goof, forfeits any chance of taking root in your imagination. Nothing matters here.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok is packed tight with zooming space vehicles and noisy thunder battles, but the movie's extravagant excess is more narcotizing than energizing. Even poor Thor seems lost in all of it, and he's supposed to be its star.\n",
      "While it's not saying much, \"Thor: Ragnarok\" is easily the best of the three Thor movies - or maybe I just think so because its screenwriters and I finally seem to agree on one thing: The Thor movies are preposterous.\n",
      "Director Peyton Reed and his army of screenwriters haven't made \"Ant-Man And The Wasp\" a terribly clever movie, but it's clever enough to keep you from reaching for bug spray. And in the summer, Marvel has apparently decided that's all that's required.\n",
      "Marvel Studios rarely goes all-on on dramatizing its themes; the series' priority is entertainment above all else, including meaning.\n",
      "The poor development of the enemies is just another consequence of the flimsy script, that is presented as one of the poorest and uninspired of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",

      "Ant-Man And The Wasp is simply a fun summer family film, but does not reach the heights or standard that Marvel has built over Phase 3.\n",
      "A well-needed break from genocide-clicking titans, this breezy sequel is adequately entertaining, but vastly forgettable.\n",
      "Now that the dust has settled, Marvel is back with a lighter, lesser sequel in the form of Ant-Man and the Wasp, a change of pace that's too busy to be breezy.\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is beige; but (in the words of Australian comic Billy Birmingham as beloved cricket commentator Richie Benaud), it's also cream, bone, off-white and perhaps ivory.\n",
      "[It's] light, fluffy and jiggly at times, it's sweet enough, but without a lot of real substance.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp isn't the worst Marvel movie ever, but it might be the most inconsequential... Eventually, repetition in action and tone neuter the film's creative energy.\n",
      "This is just filling - something to hold over hungry movie-goers - until the next Avengers movie drops next year.\n",
      "It's the rare Marvel movie you wish had a little more action.\n",
      "Once again Marvel have served up a film with all the edges blunted, where even a little passionate smooching is rendered ridiculous and sexless.\n",
      "Sadly, the movie has a hard time picking a villain to stick with... That coupled with a flat ending... results in Ant-Man and the Wasp just barely making it past passable, without earning itself a spot in the ranks of summer romp.\n",
      "Barely an hour has passed since I saw it, and it has already been reduced to dust in my memory.\n",
      "Even by Mouse House standards, this is puerile stuff. Plus a waste of serious comic talent.\n",

      "But, like Ant-Man, who gets woozy when he stretches too tall, the movie gets into trouble whenever it tries to go big.\n",
      "And while the fights and stunts are occasionally eye-catching, those eyes often end up wandering off as the combination of fast editing and quick-growing-and-shrinking props makes it hard to follow the action.\n",
      "A passably entertaining film with no answers to its biggest questions.\n",
      "Would be okay and maybe even fun were it not for the frequent presence of a gruesome ghost haunting the proceedings: a woman in constant physical and emotional agony who is trying desperately not to die. A weirdly disturbing fly in the amiable ointment.\n",
      "Aside from a few flourishes of aesthetic inventiveness and a single moment of genuine wonder, \"Ant-Man and The Wasp\" doesn't do very much with its premise.\n",
      "Underwhelming\n",
      "[I]ts plot and its comedy feel like separate entities vying for control, while the characters vie for movie's focus and heart.\n",
      "Plodding, repetitive, replete with technobabble nonsense and lifeless action, this is easily the worst-written of any of the 20 MCU offerings and may be the worst all-around film featuring a Marvel superhero since Sony rebooted Spider-Man.\n",
      "Though Rudd and Peña work like mad to get laughs, they come up well short of optimal levels achieved in Thor: Ragnarok.\n",
      "The writing is patchy throughout and the dialogue is dreck.\n",
      "The adventure is swallowed up by exhausting attempts at humor that don't land nearly often enough.\n",
      "This terminally boring, by-the-numbers installment is credited to five screenwriters and all they've come up with is an inverse game of hot potato with the usual assembly of players (the good guys, the bad guys, the law and a wild card).\n",
      "There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is all in pursuit of some MCU masterplan. If only the journey there was a bit more of a buzz.\n",
      "A light, watered-down tonic leading up to next May's Avengers 4 extravaganza.\n",
      "The earlier film's freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise.\n",
      "What came naturally, and perhaps accidentally, the first time out feels practiced and artificial here. The rhythm is, slightly but persistently, off.\n",
      "There are few, if any, surprises delivered through the course of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp.\" In fact, I was bored more than once and found myself checking the time - frequently.\n",
      "If any word sums up Ant-Man and The Wasp it's the one you never want to hear about a sequel: Extraneous.\n",
      "As much as the jokes are funny and mostly work, it starts to get in the way of the drama, or at least the emotional heft, that they're trying to go for with what is ultimately this rescue story.\n",
      "Instantly forgettable and habitually unfunny.\n",
      "Occasionally agreeable but ultimately disposable, [it's] a bauble that feels less like a fun side journey and more like a waste of everybody's time.\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp,\" the first sequel to 2015's \"Ant-Man,\" is barely an exoskeleton next to its much better predecessor.\n",
      "It's disjointed, and cluttered, but it's also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite.\n",
      "This is one of those Marvel products peddling self-aware detachment as a defining narrative strategy...It feels less like a feature film than a meme somebody made about an Ant-Man trailer.\n",
      "The basic necessities of narrative momentum are given the requisite focus and care that in better properties can produce exceptional Marvel entertainments... but in the case of Ant-Man, words like \"basic\" and \"requisite\" are always the ceiling.\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" has its moments, but it doesn't quite measure up to the original.\n",
      "As noted, it's fine and zippy and moves, constantly, almost like the magic card tricks that are introduced early and remain a touching point, a reminder that this is one joke that is not to be taken too seriously.\n",
      "The film seems to worship at the altar of tech and a form of awe at the literal manifestations of power.\n",
      "With so many characters to cover, directors Anthony and Joe Russo have no time to develop any of them, and the action set pieces are all by the numbers.\n",
      "While grand in scale, the characters are lost in the dark storyline.\n",
      "This is a film designed for superfans, and it could please many. But there inevitably comes a moment in long, episodic serials when the audience realizes that the catharsis they seek will never come.\n",
      "There's just so much CGI mayhem and the stakes are often so high that I lose interest because it's tough to care when movie after movie ... the universe [is] always at stake.\n",
      "Wildly disparate persons and their widely disparate worlds are thrown together in a potpourri of cinema that will thrill you if you're a Marvel fan, and probably leave you less exuberant if you're not.\n",
      "The story happens largely in the absence of any narrative structure.\n",
      "Infinity War highlights just how dude-centric the MCU has been for 10 years.\n",
      "Infinity War is not just trash, but it turns age-old questions of faith into trash -- and does it for fun. Maybe the best word for that is: pathetic.\n",
      "...the pseudo-TV episode Infinity War just builds upon its 18 predecessors only to burn them all to the ground to make us Tune In Next Time.\n",
      "What's impressive, as I said, is the Russo Brothers' ability to balance a dozen separate plots that connect to 18 different movies. But what's disappointing is that, even in two and a half hours, the movie never delves into any sort of real substance.\n",
      "I suppose it's par for the course, for what is the Marvel Borg collective if not a celebration of uniformity? Excuse me for asking this comic book-based \"Emperor's New Clothes\" to aim higher.\n",
      "There are too many characters in this movie for anyone to really summarize it in a cohesive manner.\n",
      "A misstep that sets up an overly predictable follow-up where repercussions are inconsequential.\n",

      "As a longtime detester of the MCU machine, I must admit that it brought me some joy.\n",
      "Not only is it incomplete despite a running time of 149 minutes... but its action would be meaningless to anyone who hasn't seen a good many previous Marvel pictures.\n",
      "Too many characters, too much plot, too much everything\n",
      "Avengers: Infinity War has trouble fitting in so many characters and giving them proper emotional moments as well as the fireworks in its 149 minute run time.\n",
      "This is why I find the movie's belief that it's doing something experimental and unprecedented more than uncomfortable: Infinity War gambles dangerously with the way people process real deaths, never mind fictional ones.\n",
      "It all amounts to heaps of superhero, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink, asinine spectacle.\n",

      "It's an infinity all right. The definition of overkill.\n",
      "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.\n",
      "Infinity War feels about as emotionally empty as a child slamming action figures together.\n",
      "Thanos is an idiot, but neither he nor the filmmakers know this.\n",
      "The movie is packed with fun banter and set pieces, but it's not really about anything, and the ending falls flat.\n",
      "Infinity War gets by with a witty first hour and the starry appeal of the cast, but the gears really grind near the finish.\n",

      "Because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided, I just can't say I enjoyed watching Infinity War all that much.\n",
      "It's a long but slight, expansive but restricted, and busy but straightforward contradiction of a movie.\n",
      "It's stunning to realize that their attempts to do so are the most emotionally affecting things in the whole of the perfectly-named Infinity War: people valiantly, desperately trying to evoke humanity in the midst of a machine that makes that impossible.\n",
      "The equivalent of a bad one-night stand with a very weak climax that you wish would've ended much, much sooner.\n",
      "Over the last decade, the Marvel movies have shown us they can be more - weirder, funnier, more eccentric, even more politically loaded than simple adventure stories. This one feels like a step backward.\n",
      "Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else.\n",
      "Avengers: Infinity War changes everything... maybe.\n",
      "...a business play forcing us to make yet another down payment on our collective Marvel mortgage.\n",

      "Maybe \"Deadpool 2\" will be better...\n",
      "Never boring, visually impressive, but ultimately rather depressing and unsatisfying, Infinity War will leave you wanting more. But not necessarily in the best way.\n",
      "It took us 19 movies over a span of 11 years to finally reach this destination. The end result? \"Infinity War\" is just too much of everything.\n",
      "It's too much. Too many characters, too much action, too much everything. It's a superhero surplus with too many heroes and not enough screen. It's Infinity overload.\n",
      "Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.\n",
      "Even by Marvel's own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails.\n",
      "Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency.\n",
      "There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time.\n",
      "Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War -- an overstuffed sausage of summer entertainment -- is the Ocean's Thirteen of spandexed heroism, if you can imagine a version of that movie with two times as many Brad Pitts and no poker dealers.\n",

      "Throughout the film, rapidity of dialogue and drama is mistaken for actual rhythm, of which directors Anthony and Joe Russo have one mode: pedal-to-the-metal pandemonium.\n",
      "There's just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story.\n",
      "Infinity War contains just about everybody...as if the sheer volume of Marvel characters would give the movie dramatic force. The opposite occurs.\n",
      "Overstuffed but underwhelming, 'Infinity War' is burdened with too many characters, too many battles, and an ending that is meant to shock but is obviously a cheap trick.\n",
      "It's that the movie itself is overblown and half-baked, and without the audience, it's something of a glorified in-joke.\n",
      "I wouldn't have believed the breezy and tongue-in-cheek Avengers Assemble would evolve into such an odiously self-important endeavour a mere seven years later.\n",
      "As fun as the movie is, there's an undeniable hollowness at its core induced by its unwillingness to follow through on certain ideas and symbols.\n",

      "Spider-Man had multiple films before the MCU where he was the title character and the focus was on him, why can't we give Holland his own Spider-Man adventure without having to bring in characters like Happy and Tony Stark?\n",
      "I very much wanted Far From Home to keep the Spider-Man strand of Marvel's experiment-slash-empire-building taut and strong. It doesn't quite hold, though; not all the way through, and not in all the places that count, either.\n",
      "The loose ends of Phase 3 prove cumbersome, and it's forced to contort several plot threads into a clumsy narrative.\n",

      "Boasting a breezy spirit and Tom Holland's likeable turn as the titular webslinger, \"Far From Home\" is adequately rousing and jokey, but too often it has the feel of a transitional chapter in the ongoing Marvel saga.\n",
      "The action, villainy, twists and overall logic fall short of its awesome predecessor.\n",
      "The film smirks and winks as if it's in on the fatigue, offering an illusion of cool when at heart it's as slavishly on-message as everything else.\n",
      "This second installment in the latest live-action Spider-Man reboot founders as it stomps through picturesque old cities in a series of ill-motivated and less-than-awesome action set-pieces.\n",
      "With every beat of the story feeling like an intense relapse of forced tension, the film becomes stupefyingly excessive in its last third.\n",
      "It's a forgettable comic book adaptation that promises something spectacular but left me scratching my head wondering if I had missed it. There's no magic in this Marvel tale.\n",
      "For me, it's another origin story that's hopefully setting up more risk-taking surprises in movies to come.\n",
      "This superhero origin story features some creatively choreographed, over-the-top martial arts mayhem while sacrificing much of its character depth and relevant cultural context along the way.\n",

      "The air goes out of the balloon, bit by bit...and the long middle acts settle into tedium, exposition and entropy.\n",
      "Shang-Chi isn't a hopeless addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe fold. But the movie feels as racked with a sense of inadequacy about its main character as that main character is about himself...\n",
      "The film uses the superficial markers of Asian culture and filmmaking without presenting anything unique in its Marvel take on that tradition.\n",
      "An overreliance on CGI tempers the excitement of the action scenes until it gives into the effects entirely during a devolving stretch of underwritten characters and a story that does not do justice to its protagonist.\n",
      "Shang-Chi is a film that isn't completely sure what it wants to be, other than an Asian American hero in the MCU. The Master of Kung Fu deserves better.\n",
      "Falls in the medium-low end of the MCU spectrum. Lots of flashy CGI-assisted martial arts action, but it never helps when your main character is the least interesting person onscreen.\n",
      "Though Shang-Chi introduces what could've been one of Marvel's most compelling villains ever, even the magic of Tony Leung can't save the film from tumbling into mediocrity thanks to an uninspired script and a bumbling third act.\n",

      "What might have been a fascinating interplay of psychologies and ideas, is rendered in broad, lifeless strokes.\n",
      "Eternals is somehow Marvel's most ambitious movie and also its worst.\n",
      "Eternals is dull, it's boring, and it's quite epically uninvolving.\n",
      "The one exception to the film's utterly bloodless chemistry is a cameo by a post-credits pop star who, for all of 15 seconds, has a completely charming interaction with a CG creature. I believed that performance more than anything in the 2.5 hours.\n",
      "Bring in the portentous overreach of the Eternals' cosmos-shaking storyline, though, and her talent is diminished. For Zhao, bigger is not better.\n",
      "At its best, this is galaxy-brain, comic-book stuff rooted in a tactile sense of place.\n",
      "Clearly, we're supposed to leave the cinema filled with an urgent sense of anticipation. But all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end.\n",
      "Chloé Zhao's take on the Marvel Universe is a far cry from her last film, Nomadland. While Eternals has its moments, it is not one of the Marvel greats.\n",
      "The enthralling action set-pieces have to be parsed from in-between awkward moments in which characters stand around waiting to explain themselves. The wildly inconsistent tone moves from laugh-out-loud to deadly earnest...\n",
      "Despite being 2 hours 37 minutes long, Eternals feels rushed, like it's trying to squeeze a ten-episode series into one feature film.\n",
      "An ambitious mess and a fascinating failure\n",
      "A slack film, in the way one gets to be when one has no pressing need to come in at a reasonable running time.\n",
      "Eternals creates the illusion of a maturity that would have elevated it to director Chloé Zhao's standards. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "None of the characters come across and compelling...yes, these being are supposed to be immortal, but you'll feel as if you're time with the Eternals has lasted for an eternity.\n",
      "Eternals is not a good movie. It's not a good comic book movie, it's not a good action movie, it's not a good Marvel movie. It somehow feels overstuffed and empty at the same time. It's muddled and convoluted. It's a bland and boring and bewildering mess.\n",
      "Eternals is a mess, a beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. There is a far more interesting movie under all that flotsam. In better hands, the movie could have been something special. All Zhao has provided is a bland, dull film.\n",
      "I came out disappointed having witnessed an imbalanced, slightly messy, uninspiring, and sadly boring slog.\n",
      "For all its flaws, it is far from the worst entry in the MCU, but it is, perhaps, the first of Marvel's films to be less than the sum of its parts.\n",
      "In many ways, what it means to be human is the central question that drives Eternals... But the movie's dizzying star power and twisty backstories render it too clunky and overstuffed to concisely answer said central question.\n",
      "Marvel is the peanut butter of movies, Zhao is the filet mignon of directors, and I just wasn't fully enjoying my peanut butter steak.\n",
      "It's not that none of the movie works. It's that none of it works for very long.\n",
      "The MCU's first DCEU film.\n",

      "[Director Chloé Zhao] is in the mouth of the Marvel beast with this one. It can devour even the most able-eyed filmmaker, which is exactly what Eternals does.\n",
      "For all the effort that has gone into ensuring representation in the casting, the storytelling, with its forced flashbacks and synthetic sentiment, lets the whole thing down.\n",
      "But like Galactus gobbling a planet, Zhao's unique filmmaking style has been subsumed by the mighty Marvel maw\n",
      "With 10 superheroes to introduce and millennia of backstories to plough through, this 157-minute slog requires superhuman levels of endurance.\n",
      "The MCU reaches a theatrical low point with \"Eternals,\" an odd team-up adventure that teases a franchise the future of which might be better suited for Disney's streaming service.\n",
      "Even acclaimed filmmaker Chloe Zhao, who collected Best Picture and Director Oscars for last year's 'Nomadland,' can't save her first venture into the MC Universe from being laughable too often in all the wrong places.\n",
      "Regardless of Zhao's (and Marvel's) intentions, \"Eternals\" is a parade of faces without experience, a movie that reaches back and forth through history and comes back empty-handed.\n",
      "Trying to save the world shouldn't be boring, but Eternals is one big giant yawn - and easily the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Chloe Zhao is a very talented director, but perhaps it was too much to expect her go from the sparse, quiet life of Nomadland to this special effects driven action blockbuster with a huge cast of characters who are not very exciting.\n",
      "While it delivers the action and eye candy, \"Eternals\" is middling Marvel.\n",
      "This is one of the more forgettable MCU movies, despite the direction of Oscar winner Chloé Zhao.\n",
      "Where should we start-the bored facial expressions, the flaccid cinematography, or the complete lack of chemistry between two insanely hot people?\n",
      "I wish somebody would give a map to exit the Marvel Universe at some point. I felt like I was lost in a made up world I did not particularly care about.\n",
      "Eternals seems to exist in the bizarre liminal space between expectations and indifference.\n",
      "At a glacial pace of 2 hours and 37 minutes, the movie occasionally feels eternal, and it sags under that weight.\n",
      "I certainly can't get emotionally invested anymore...it's just a series of special effects interspersed with a bit of humor...\n",
      "The entire movie felt like an overlong parody...\n",

      "Never have the stakes been higher or as instantly forgettable in a Marvel movie as this.\n",
      "The story is built on a series of plot elements that have already been used to greater effect in other, better films. Consequently, Eternals is predictable, and at over two and a half hours, much too long.\n",
      "Running almost long enough for a pair of films, Zhao flits between her characters and only occasionally gives them room to shine. If she cut her team down to the size of a basketball squad, there would be more room for chemistry and character development.\n",
      "All of the effects-driven spectacle serves a silly and overwrought story that leaves little room for meaningful character development or emotional depth.\n",
      "I don't think Zhao should be chided for attempting a film so seemingly outside her comfort zone. No director should have to commit to a career of specialization. The only qualm I have about Eternals is that it's not better.\n",
      "Eternals is a frustratingly dense and heinously overcomplicated film that loses Zhao's delicate filmmaking sensibilities in its rush to introduce swathes of new Marvel heroes.\n",
      "Chloe Zhao has succumbed to corporate filmmaking anonymity.\n",
      "I admire the ambition. I worry that Marvel will take away the message not to take any more chances and return to formula. That's not the right decision.\n",
      "Too many C-team superheroes...\n",
      "There is plenty to criticize in Eternals-and some things that I might praise, in another story set in another universe-but I'm not sure any story set in this universe could possibly offer anything to care about one way or the other.\n",
      "As big as things are in the film, the stakes have never felt any smaller.\n",
      "Little is at stake, and there is a tenuous - at best - connection with the rest of the Marvel heroes and villains.\n",
      "Only the gift of eternal life will stop you looking at your watch, willing the final credits to hove in to sight.\n",

      "Eternals is the least fun I've ever had in a MCU film.\n",
      "Eternals arrives as Marvel's greatest failure and feels like the worst Power Rangers adaptation yet conceived.\n",

      "While sometimes when Marvel gets out of its comfort zone, audiences enjoy gems like Guardians of the Galaxy, this time the results are far less successful and quite frankly disappointing.\n",
      "Eternals is an unfocused mess of a story that features a wonderfully diverse cast that has no chemistry.\n",
      "The thought of a total bomb detonating onscreen is a ripe prospect, until a doomed movie demonstrates that it is just bad, as minute by minute, hour by hour, you sit through one like Eternals.\n",
      "This is without a doubt the worst MCU film to date and the sort of rancid theater experience that makes you want to rethink the whole thing and burn it to the ground.\n",
      "The elements seem to be there for \"Eternals\" to further stretch the boundaries of what constitutes a Marvel movie but too much of the time, it settles for being more of the same.\n",
      "It's sprawling and somber, collapsing under the weight of its own misguided ambitions.\n",

      "Something as huge in scale and scope on the surface shouldn't seem this dull and perfunctory.\n",
      "At a run time of two hours and thirty-seven minutes, the movie drags at points and doesn't really seem to be going anywhere very fast.\n",
      "There's something uniformly placid about the performances, not helped by the cameo-length appearances by much of the wasted cast...\n",
      "Zhao unfurls the story of the Eternals on an epic and elaborate stage ... that ends up being a double-edged sword. We get a grandiose mythology ... alongside backstories ... [but] we are never given the time to understand, care for, or connect with them.\n",
      "There are some nice touches and an attractive new diversity worn lightly, but this is an underpowered and uncertain film.\n",
      "Eternals, despite trying to be a departure from the superhero generic norm, misses wide of the mark and ends up being a major lapse.\n",
      "Marvel's bid for a \"Suicide Squad\" level bust.\n",
      "Call me basic, but I miss the old Marvel. Eternals is not all bad, and will appeal to many. An unnecessary sex scene makes it non-kid-friendly for some families.\n",
      "Sluggishly directed, it's a thunderously dull bland-out stuffed with all the things we've seen quite enough of: fights with big-jawed monsters; eyes that shoot energy beams; self-important longueurs; an all-but-incomprehensible story. Seriously: enough.\n",
      "The pacing's off, the constant jumping between past and present doesn't help the flow of the story, and none of the set pieces leap off the screen.\n",

      "Its an ambitious, sprawling story that feels bogged down by it's own superhero antics and messy execution. For better or worse, its Marvel's least Marvel film to date. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Eternals suffers from bland lead characters... and the villains are very lackluster.\n",
      "Zhao is an undeniably gifted filmmaker, but Eternals does not make effective use of those gifts and by the end, there is the undeniable sense that she became as tired of the whole thing while making it as viewers will be while watching it.\n",
      "A blockbuster of unusual gentle beauty that also strains to fulfill the gargantuan requirements of a massive action spectacle.\n",
      "Marvel's latest is a litany of cosmic, philosophical and expositional verbiage, clumsily expressed by a talented but uneven cast through their cryptic characters, that try to pass it off as thematic and emotional depth. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "There's not enough apparent experience with anything approaching human emotions to make an exploration of these beings' complicated feelings possible, much less interesting.\n",
      "There are so many flickers of fabulous texture and life struggling valiantly to get out, that it makes the general inertia and frustrayting flatness even more painful.\n",
      "Too many characters, too little plot, too many flashbacks, not enough action, and too much conversation.\n",
      "One of the least engaging of all the Marvel movies-big and splashy but lumbering and strangely dull.\n",
      "\"Eternals\" makes history as the most diverse superhero movie in terms of race, gender, orientation, age and abilities...and that's remarkable...But that doesn't change the fact that they're stuck in a story that's dull and predictable.\n",
      "It's way too much character development for one movie - just imagine if we had met all of the Avengers at the same time\n",
      "In the end, Eternals is a fine movie - and sometimes significantly more than that - that is too mired in exposition and predictable, franchise-informed plotting.\n",
      "Zhao has graduated from delicate artisanal indies to overprocessed, soul-challenged, assembly-line Hollywood junk in record time.\n",
      "A jumble of clunky dialogue and exposition dumps with no stakes until the typical VFX-packed climactic fights. Eternals is one of the most flavorless films in the Marvel Universe.\n",
      "Zhao is a baffling choice: a filmmaker who is ill-equipped and out of her element, with her discomfort visible across nearly every frame of the film.\n",
      "Eternals is unlikely to leave audiences wanting more (or remembering much), though it may well whet the appetite for the day when the Fantastic Four and X-Men finally arrive.\n",
      "...won't sell many toys, subscriptions or tickets for Disney. If nothing else, it'll remind audiences what it feels like to be bored to distraction in the cinema...\n",
      "I'm sorry to tell you this movie is a mess.\n",
      "Don't blame the progressive nods for film's failures ... the limp plot does the damage.\n",
      "ETERNALS undoubtedly [expands] the universe of possible stories [as] the series looks to move into a new era. However, the conflicting approaches felt here reveal that this range of films isn't ready or willing to expand how it tells those stories.\n",
      "Where Kubrick and Clarke took seriously the idea that human evolution may be prompted by alien intercession, Eternalsmakes the whole thing part of some gargantuan, intergalactic eugenics experiment wrapped in pop-philosophy and popcorn-authoritarianism.\n",
      "Representation should be the headline-grabber for Eternals, but instead, the conversation around the film will likely focus on how much of a disappointment it is.\n",
      "The star-studded supergod origin story is all bland fight sequences, cold flashbacks, and blank faces taking in stunning vistas.\n",
      "This sounds kind of fun. And I wish it were. But with the exception of Kumail Nanjiani who offers, without question, the only real reason to see the movie, the story takes itself far too seriously for fun or, really, even logic.\n",
      "Ultimately, the film feels like a pet between two owners, and it's confused on exactly who to run to.\n",
      "A particular dud, and Marvel's worst in years. The mythology is ridiculous, the cast overstuffed, and the action unimpressive.\n",
      "If Eternals stuck to the multi-million dollar blueprint, it could have been one of the more fascinating MCU entries instead of the most disappointing effort to date.\n",
      "In many ways Eternals is not a Chloe Zhao problem as much as it is an MCU problem. After the lights came back on my first thought was that this is where comic book movies have \"jumped the shark\".\n",
      "Certainly a revamp, even if it doesn't prove to be a particularly refreshing one.\n",
      "It's ugly, charisma-free, dour, overlong, exposition-heavy, patronizing, and, worst of all, it has none of the heart even feinted at by the least successful films within the MCU canon.\n",
      "it's pretty clear that Zhao's empathy for unaffected performers rambling in lingering magic-hour landscapes has won the day.\n",
      "\"Here is a list of things not to do, if you want to make a Marvel movie that will not be mocked until Tony Stark returns to life.\"\n",
      "Meant to be Shakespearean in tone but is too often blocked like Shakespeare in the Park.\n",
      "It takes a special kind of movie anti-magic to make an entire audience indifferent to the potential destruction of the planet and the elimination of all life and Earth. \"Eternals\" manages it.\n",
      "Zhao, a director whose previous three films have all centered on the everyday lives of working-class rural outsiders, seems ill-suited to a movie of this scale and frankly uninterested in the fight scenes.\n",
      "Watching Chloé Zhao's The Rider made me want to learn horseback riding. Nomadland illustrated the reality houseless Americans face and offered a window into the American West. Both intertwine fiction and reality. I knew Eternals was going to be different.\n",
      "Involves a lot of windy locations, sparse imagination for action, and a cast of characters who are seldom interesting.\n",
      "While I can respect that the MCU took a risk by telling an ambitious and different kind of story, the story and storytelling simply didn't match the film's ambitions.\n",
      "People will decide for themselves whether its innovations are enough or not, but for me it was somewhat disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "From visuals to music choice, there's a lack of style here that is only further emphasized by the film's refusal to focus.\n",
      "Eternals is so busy showing off what it can do, where it can go, that it bypasses and overlooks what it really has to offer. There are real dilemmas, real battles of interest buried beneath the soft-pedaled, naturally-lit, cozy surfaces of this movie.\n",
      "While I appreciate that Eternals takes a creative risk with its time-jumping events, its convoluted plot ultimately lets it down.\n",
      "Eternals feels like a balloon that tried to hold it all together but was filled to bursting; it's too much-and not enough. The result is a very ambitious, very well made, kind of flat, and unfortunately forgettable film.\n",
      "It flies high, grapples with huge themes and ideas, tries to keep check with humour and heart, but the whole thing feels so overblown and overwrought that you kind of walk out of the screen in a daze.\n",
      "This film is achingly earnest in tackling issues of diversity and representation, but fails as engrossing entertainment\n",
      "A film that is constantly at war with itself, for nearly three hours.\n",
      "What seemed like the perfect marriage of filmmaker and studio, Oscar winner Chloé Zhao and Marvel Studios, turns out to be one of, if not, the biggest misfires since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began.\n",
      "Its main downfall is a confusing script with inconsistently written characters stuck in a timeline that makes it impossible to build momentum or tell a story that makes sense.\n",
      "Despite the depth of the ensemble (and the acting talents assembled to bring it to life), these Eternals really only come in three varieties: brooding, quippy, and both.\n",
      "The Marvel Cinematic Universe wades chin deep into a soap opera river of melodramatic tears. Director Chloé Zhao treads sappy with a convoluted exploration of relationships in Eternals.\n",
      "For a film about millennia-old space gods with X-Men powers... Eternals feels decidedly pedestrian, its flashes of naturalism still drowned in the usual Feige trappings.\n",
      "At once bloated and rushed, Eternals suffers from frequent lurches in tempo that dispel its occasional moments of tranquil thoughtfulness.\n",
      "The things that made Chloe Zhao's indie movies special didn't translate to massive blockbuster filmmaking.\n",
      "Seriously, what a snooze. Fresh off of winning the Best Director Oscar for \"Nomadland,\" Chloé Zhao has upchucked one of the MCU's worst movies in ages.\n",
      "This big budget action film will hit theaters just in time for Thanksgiving, which reaches the chef's kiss of utter perfection because it's a $200 million turkey.\n",
      "There's a small comfort in knowing that there probably never will be a Marvel film like this one. Even if you end up hating it or finding it completely forgettable.\n",
      "A frustratingly protracted rumpus of showdowns and duels in which characters spontaneously summon unknown talents to best combatants with equally undisclosed faculties.\n",
      "Feels a bit like homework: If you don't want the rest of the class to move on without you, it's mandatory; but in the end, you'll just be glad to turn it in and move along to the next thing.\n",
      "A disappointment of cosmic proportions, Eternals never takes off due to a pedestrian script that wastes a galaxy of talent. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "A convoluted cosmic misfire and one of Marvel's dullest efforts in years.\n",
      "The weight of complicated exposition weakens the energy of Eternals a little too often. It's at its best when the focus is on the Eternals recreating their family -- the humor of it and the passion when they fight for each other and the things they love.\n",
      "Eternals may not be the worst of Marvel's movies, but it's undoubtedly the most disappointing.\n",
      "Boy, does this patchy, paceless film go on for an eternity.\n",
      "It's constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit whatsoever to the film at hand.\n",
      "'Eternals' shows Marvel making the same mistakes (generic superhero characters, dull effects-driven action, making the entire film a prologue for the sequel, etc.) as its rivals.\n",
      "You walk out in the depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make.\n",
      "One of Marvel's most ambitious movies in years is also one of its weakest since \"Thor: The Dark World.\"\n",
      "It's not exactly boring - there's always something new to behold - but nor it is particularly exciting, and it lacks the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies.\n",
      "Eternals certainly doesn't lack for ambition, but for now, Marvel -- emboldened by its success -- has reached for the stars without quite getting there.\n",
      "Eternals is a mess.\n",
      "Can't these movies do anything else? Is it too much to ask the most dominant kind of cinema on the planet to shake things up and challenge itself in a more significant way?\n",
      "A mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances.\n",
      "Giant stories are by their nature hard to wrap your head, or your heart, around. But Ant-Man and the Wasp's smaller-than-life stakes give its characters, and its plot, room to breathe.\n",
      "Thompson's character is as endearing as Idris Elba's is forceful. Even when Heimdall isn't on screen, his presence is very much felt as a shepherd of both the plot points and the people inhabiting Asgard.\n",
      "The film may not be one of Marvel's very best, but it shows that the studio still has the ability to wow audiences on the big screen.\n",
      "For the most part, Endgame delivers on the unique brand of humor, action and drama that Marvel has down to a science at this point.\n",
      "Arrives in theaters as an adequate superhero film, complete with many of the strengths and weaknesses of the genre.\n",
      "A fitting and often fabulous sign-off for one of the Avengers' most memorable heroes.\n",
      "The closest thing to an agenda this movie may take on is simply having more female representation, while not compromising the comic book story of Captain Marvel in the process.\n",
      "Doctor Strange once again proves that when it comes to superhero movies, Marvel has its finger firmly on the pulse.\n",
      "Doctor Strange manages to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe while also telling a satisfying story in its own isolated corner.\n",
      "Bravo James Gunn; he took a lesser-known comic book and spun it into the most entertaining ride I've had all year.\n",
      "While the fights were entertaining to watch, none of them would've have been successful without the amazing performances from the cast.\n",
      "Downey's richly human performance as a reformed rake who relies on his intelligence, feels both personal and genuinely fresh.\n",
      "Like its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is a fine example of how impressive big budget studio filmmaking can be when it's done right.\n",
      "This thoroughly engaging reimagination of the Marvel comic book that debuted in the '70s has been retrofitted for its movie debut, and the results are encouraging to say the least.\n",
      "Captain Marvel is a retro-tastic origin story worthy of its namesake, capturing the strength and heart of the comics.\n",
      "Joe Johnston -- returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, The Rocketeer (1991) -- creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story.\n",
      "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 builds on the franchise with everything that makes this Marvel offering unique. But most of all it's the music that works wonders here.\n",
      "Swinton and Cumberbatch are both delightful, although I'm not sure I've ever seen either one have a bad showing.\n",
      "Black Widow's triumphant return to the big screen parallels the dark storyline with the real-life horrors of human trafficking, domestic violence, and historical female oppression.\n",
      "What matters is Downey's total commitment to playing Stark as a flawed, complex, but greatly gifted character.\n",
      "Zhao's \"Eternals\" offers an alternative approach to the repetitive Marvel movies.\n",
      "What's left is the movie's middle 60% or so, which is a fun ride, though I could have done without the 3-D.\n",
      "Expectations surpassed. An ambitious, exhilarating and deeply satisfying culmination to a decade of great Marvel films. Thanos now reigns as the best villain of the MCU. Period. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "By delivering a superhero film that offers stunning performances from Liu and Leung while celebrating Asian culture ... Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a tour de force.\n",
      "Robert Downey Jr. carries this superhero saga with his wit and clever improvised quips.\n",
      "\"A deviation from the Marvel formula, a gloriously, defiant weird movie that nevertheless proves to be an enormous crowd-pleaser.\"\n",
      "Without the weight of the entire MCU resting on his shoulders, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fine way to settle this superhero universe back down.\n",
      "A masterful, entertaining and brilliantly smart Marvel instalment, Black Panther is the superhero film we need right now. We may not deserve it.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok proves that he who does not risk does not win. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Shows Marvel have mastered the art of the C+ despite getting wonderfully weird at times.\n",
      "The type of super-heroine that cinema currently needs and fragile fanboys don't deserve\n",
      "It's the Marvel movie we've been waiting for, and though it's an excellent film, I just couldn't shake the fact that I was watching a movie of a hero that has died. - @VinceSchilling\n",
      "a mischievous mix of sweet high school romcom, fun teenage spy caper and exciting superhero CGI spectacular\n",
      "Despite several adrenaline-pumping moments, Favreau and Downey stay focused on the real story -- about a man learning to take responsibility for his actions. For all its firepower and CGI slickness, that's what really makes Iron Man fly.\n",
      "As watchable as a Baby Groot dancing GIF, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 merrily continues the saga of its lovable band of space rascals.\n",
      "If you're the sort of viewer for whom Black's strengths more than make up for his weaknesses, the best bits of Iron Man 3 will make the lesser stuff worth forgiving -- or at least worth enduring.\n",
      "Superior to and far more enjoyable than its predecessor. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)\n",
      "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an upper-echelon MCU film, and like the very best of them, it only leaves you salivating for the next installment.\n",
      "There is little in this film that is new, but that doesn't matter. The characters are still entertaining, the action scenes thrilling and near orgasmic, and the human relationships touching.\n",
      "Captain Marvel succeeds as a rollicking-good film in its own right. Accessible to newbies and satisfying to fans, it's about time that brilliant performers like Larson were given their time in the spotlight.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok is the wittiest and most straightforwardly enjoyable of Marvel's blockbusters.\n",
      "Shellhead's back! And nearly finishes himself off in blockbuster sequel\n",
      "Infinity War challenges aspects of this genre that we have come to expect and it will leave you stunned.\n",
      "Hiddleston is clearly having a blast as a god who lives for chaos and he brings a jolt of pure devilish pleasure to every scene he is in.\n",
      "Gunn provides enough explosions to satisfy action-hungry audiences, and after a third-act dip, the movie picks up for an ending that tempers the obligatory mayhem with a bit of emotion.\n",
      "The Avengers is an engaging-enough film. But with that kind of treasure, talent and time, you'd expect more -- a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers.\n",
      "[Dave Batista as] Drax is amazing in this movie. I liked him in the first movie, but I loved him in this movie.\n",
      "These are the things I love in Thor films, and thank goodness they are all present in Thor: The Dark World. What is missing, unfortunately, is the original's sense of ebullient entertainment.\n",
      "I laughed more than a few times, in the right places, and you will, too. It helps that the four main actors are among the best you can hire.\n",
      "[T]he best Marvel yet, with the greatest superhero action on film. It's immense, marvelous action-packed fun... [T]he single greatest pure superhero movie ever made.\n",
      "...an epic romp across the breadth if the Marvel Cinematic Universe with all the action, comedy, pageantry, and sturm und drangyou could hope for.\n",
      "Brie Larson steps into Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel's boots for the first time and it's a blast to see the Room Oscar-winner transform into a superhero in this solidly entertaining, if regrettably conventional, origins story.\n",
      "This may not be the best Marvel Studios film, but I actually think it might be the best, or at least the smartest, Marvel Comics movie out there.\n",
      "...a solid, important entry in the MCU. Brie Larson and Carol Danvers are here now. We shouldn't want it any other way.\n",
      "'Spider-Man: Far from Home' doesn't stray from Marvel's Midas touch\n",
      "There's a great deal of effort involved in making this film and I am full of admiration - even if not especially keen to see it again\n",
      "This is a pleasant diversion and an antidote to the glummer Spideys we saw from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield; there's also good business from Downey and from Jon Favreau.\n",
      "If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.\n",
      "In a summer with films that used the family dynamic to create dramatic tension, Shang-Chi does it as good as any -- with some strong emotional moments.\n",
      "Nothing that I say will may a bit of difference to the MCU fans and, especially, those of the Panther. But, as an outsider and non-fan of the Universe, I kind of enjoyed it.\n",
      "This is an incredible action movie. From special effects to fights to explosions, it hits every marker. But the movie is so much more. It's hysterically funny, charming and smart.\n",
      "Avengers: Age of Ultron may be very similar to the original film, but that's ok, for it still results in an equally thrilling ride.\n",
      "At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies.\n",
      "\"'The Winter Soldier' not only satisfies with its plentiful action scenes, it also offers some intriguing commentary on the current political and world climate, and turns out to be a sterling character piece.\"\n",
      "Even those who are virulently against the domination of superhero stories at multiplexes these days will find themselves coming out of this one eager for more.\n",
      "The best thing in the film is, in fact, its take on Captain America that makes it great, as Evans plays Cap as Jimmy Stewart on steroids...\n",
      "As amiable as he is, Spidey's presence compromises the very stakes Civil War is trying to pitch.\n",
      "It's hard to deny that the Infinity Saga has been an incredibly singular achievement, and Endgame is the finale it has always deserved.\n",
      "Tessa's got the comedic timing to match Taika Waititi's Thor humor, and the physicality to lead the movie's pack of superheroes. She's not trying to outdo the boys; she's just trying to sip her drink and mind her own business.\n",
      "A fun, adventurous space romp. I had some popcorn, I dug it. Would I want to see another one? Yes, but I have a lot of questions...good questions.\n",
      "It's spectacular, yet can leave you exhausted.\n",
      "With its sharp dialogue and rock soundtrack, [Taika] Waiti has delivered one of the funnest films in the MCU.\n",
      "Along the way, it works as a warm and funny high-school dramedy, an exciting action-adventure, and an old-fashioned superhero/supervillain battle.\n",
      "An ungainly, cheeky swing from rooftop to rooftop has rarely been more endearing.\n",
      "A cheerfully satisfying throwback that embraces the innocence of the comics while adding the spectacle of modern SFX technique.\n",
      "... such a disappointment, though still worth seeing.\n",
      "The directors demonstrate how to juggle disparate segments while maintaining an emotional thread.\n",
      "Fans won't be disappointed in Thor: Ragnorak.\n",
      "A surprising amount of humor served with a heaping of 90s nostalgia, but suffers from a less-than-perfect origin story.\n",
      "A no-holds-barred if uneven epic that should satisfy most diehard fans.\n",
      "Though \"Thor: Ragnarok\" may feel like a lightweight entertainment, it comes packed with the same ingredients that made Whedon's \"The Avengers\" so good.\n",
      "\"Black Widow\" is a decent action vehicle and spy thriller, even if it feels a bit paint-by-numbers and years late to the screen.\n",
      "There is the feeling that the expansive world of this ongoing Marvel saga is no longer spinning its wheels, but headed somewhere potentially fresh and exciting.\n",
      "Sci-fi hasn't been this fun since Star Wars and it hasn't been this funny since Galaxy Quest.\n",
      "If this is only The First Avenger, then bring on the rest of them.\n",
      "Comic-book movie delivers the goods\n",
      "Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.\n",
      "Pick a formula. Include a wonderful actor. Make everything work in spite of the unoriginality that's working against it. You get \"Ant-Man.\"\n",
      "Thor is a really good popcorn flick -- just a little too bloated in places to hit the mark as well as it could have.\n",
      "What makes this movie stand out from the majority of action movies is that it is more character-driven than most. It is about family relationships as much as it is about the mission.\n",
      "What really seals the deal is Hemsworth's undeniable charisma, making us ignore the patchiness of the scene changes and the occasional dialogue howler.\n",
      "Trying to make a sequel that was going to be as good or feel as fresh as the original was a near-impossible task, but Gunn has managed to deliver a film that's a hell of a lot of fun to watch, while also giving it depth and heart to spare.\n",

      "In short, Captain Marvel is a blast.\n",
      "An amazing Spider-Man, a spectacular Spider-Man, and yes, the ultimate Spider-Man.\n",
      "'Ant-Man' is a blast. It is funny, clever and its view of the world in miniature is often spectacular.\n",
      "...a surplus of thrilling escapism inside a movie that clocks in at just less than two hours. You wonder why it took the Harry Potter films eight films to get where they were going.\n",
      "... strap yourself in, endure the opening 30 minutes and you'll get to the most hilariously self-aware Marvel film in the series.\n",
      "It's a fun adventure with lots of comedy weaved in, but it's full of surprises.\n",
      "While Baby Groot is almost painfully adorable, it's Bautista's hilariously open-hearted Drax who steals the show.\n",
      "...it feels like a simpler, smaller movie, which couldn't be more appropriate, considering the powers of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The movie knows that junk art is still art, that no one is more in need of something to speak for them than the inarticulate - and with that it takes the secret pull of comic geekdom and elevates it to a kind of bittersweet, obsessive romanticism.\n",
      "There have been few must-see films of the 2014 summer season, but Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one.\n",
      "Funny without being tongue-in-cheek and epic without being ponderous, Spider-Man: Homecoming is what a summer movie should be.\n",

      "It's a quality action movie that accomplishes, with seeming ease, a number of difficult things.\n",
      "With Black Panther, [Coogler] took really, really strong material here and elevated it once again.\n",
      "It recaptures that feeling of running home with a new four-color comic, opening the pages, and delighting in the out-of-this-world adventures detailed within.\n",
      "There's too much superfluity for Iron Man 2 to be a great comic-book movie, but when it's good, it's exactly the kind of summer entertainment people are looking for.\n",
      "Fans of Natasha getting her own movie will be satisfied with Black Widow. The film does more than enough on exploring the character and domestic drama while serving up the typical car chases and explosive third acts that we've come to expect from Marvel.\n",
      "I'm a very happy person right now...a good sequel, a good time, and I can't wait to see what they do with Tom Holland as Spider-Man...there's an aspect that feels fresh because it's not in New York City the whole time.\n",
      "Thrilling when it wants to be, it's got star power to spare, and the action and effects are top-notch.\n",
      "It's Iron Man 3's sneaky expos of superhero cool--on the outside, a wisecracking warrior; on the inside, an anxiety-attacked guy who tries to insulate himself with arrogance--that brings this blockbuster down to sympathetic size.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel Studios' best and certainly the most punk rock.\n",
      "A movie with just so many great parts to it. I guarantee later, if part of it comes on, you'll stick around to watch the whole thing.\n",
      "Looking better than ever with characters you've spent over a decade with, Avengers: Endgame manages to find an incredible balance between gut-wrenching character moments and truly fantastic action sequences.\n",
      "Clever, funny, cool Marvel movie has lots of sci-fi action.\n",
      "Aided by a formidable performance from Hong Kong superstar Tony Leung, director Destin Daniel Cretton doesn't quite remake the Marvel wheel so much as he enlivens it with the kinetic, charming and surprisingly heartfelt Shang-Chi.\n",
      "The Avengers does have is a solid gold structure that doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast.\n",
      "A rocking space odyssey that gate crashes Marvel's cinematic stable and instantly becomes the life of the party\n",
      "It embraces its female empowerment narrative without needing to belabour it, putting forward an entertaining story first and lacing in its timely subtext as a bonus.\n",

      "So yeah, I liked Spider-Man: Homecoming. I laughed during the funny parts, felt moved during the moving parts, and got excited during the exciting parts. And that Tom Holland -- he seems like a good kid.\n",
      "If the rest of the popcorn movie entries exceed expectations on this level, then the forthcoming shirtless hero worship season might give me washboard abs - \"Conan,\" \"Captain America\" and \"Sinbad\" are yet to come.\n",

      "It's no masterpiece but fun enough to continue to whet the appetite for The Avengers.\n",
      "Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.\n",
      "Visually, this is a hallucinatory wet dream. However, like the character in the film, Doctor Strange offers a spellbinding exploration of what lies beyond the stars yet lacks the proper mastery of the mystical concepts it introduces.\n",
      "Black Panther strikes a chord for humanity.\n",
      "Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.\n",

      "Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a brilliant action movie, that serves up a huge dose of wish fulfillment along with its bravura fight scenes.\n",
      "A high-octane spectacular filled with surprises, twists and action sequences that are pure mayhem. The film's conceit is as large as its scale.\n",
      "Still lively and likeable, despite the sprawling techno-bloat and general over-stuffing.\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War is fun; it's too well made, acted and scripted for it to be anything less.\n",
      "Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true \"summer movie spectacular\" of the 2012 season.\n",
      "Despite the crisis-of-conscience theme, all of this could have been pretty standard fare. But Favreau had the sense to cast Downey, who does for this potential franchise what Johnny Depp did for Pirates of the Caribbean.\n",
      "Super Fun, Super Exciting,\n",
      "A miraculous blend of grief and humor. Big, bold, brash, then sneakily meta. I am only starting to get my head around the emotional and creative right-hook of it. A fitting end (for now) to the MCU.\n",
      "Possibly the greatest - and most ambitious - superhero movie to date.\n",
      "\"Far From Home\" gets closer, in spirit, to the good Tobey Maguire films.\n",
      "In a film that is mostly colourless, David Harbour stands out with an undeniable shade of red.\n",
      "While it's perhaps a little fanciful to look for profound messages in this film, Gunn does have valid things to say about the importance, or otherwise, of family ties.\n",
      "Tom Holland is a charismatic actor with ability to play a Peter Parker in which coexist the superhero and the teenager in crisis. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",

      "While they absolutely stick the landing in the third act, getting to it is a bit of a chore.\n",
      "This maelstrom of violence is exhilarating, but you'll forget about it before you reach home.\n",
      "The biggest, the boldest and the most ambitious movie yet to come from Marvel Studios.\n",
      "Far more lively than anything in the last three Star Wars; it's far closer in the constellation to the jokey heroism of Joss Whedon's Serenity than George Lucas's New Age sky-piloting.\n",
      "While slightly overlong, this movie is bright, creative, insightful, affecting and, above all else, fun.\n",
      "You can feel the sameness of Black Panther ... Watching the film, though, is to see something completely different in the realm of these stories.\n",
      "Enjoyable but half the measure of the original\n",
      "Captain Marvel is enjoyable enough as popcorn entertainment.\n",
      "The film's real conflict is idealism versus realism... The actualization of that conflict gives the Russo brothers an anchor around which to stage half a dozen top-flight superhero battles.\n",
      "The first Marvel film in forever that doesn't climax with our heroes mowing down a generic horde of non-human nobodies.\n",
      "Frantic, place-holding sequel? Check. Third installment guaranteed? Check.\n",
      "It should never have been this good.\n",
      "It doesn't take a Sherlock to see that 'Doctor Strange' successfully sends the Marvel Universe spinning in a mystical new direction.\n",
      "This movie is perfectly pitched as a sweet pick-me-up, a human-sized romp that looks back to the blip, while moving the story forward.\n",
      "The pivotal realization--that, in the end, using your heart beats using your head--works as a pithy instruction manual for this diverting but disposable adventure.\n",
      "Brisk humour, keenly felt dramatic stakes, and invention over scale. You know: small pleasures.\n",
      "Ant-Man works within the framework of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also delivers a streamlined, fast-paced, lively and -- frankly -- utterly charming story.\n",
      "Its scope is large enough to please fans well versed in the source material, but its tone is light enough to make it a mainstream hit.\n",
      "Avengers: Age Of Ultron is a big, bold, funny, thrilling, absorbing triumph, and continues Marvel Studios' seeming push for world cinematic domination.\n",
      "Bottom line: The film was funny.\n",
      "Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along\n",
      "It taps into what the first three Star Wars films knew and the next three forgot: big heart and a sense of humor are what keep heavy machinery running smoothly.\n",
      "You won't mistake Ant-Man and the Wasp for anything particularly deep or even all that ambitious, but it is certainly a fun diversion.\n",
      "[A] grand and worthy sequel that packs an emotional wallop and brilliant visuals.\n",
      "Johansson once again embodies a character driven by her pain; now we know where it comes from. Pugh is outstanding, tapping into some of that same pain but making it her own.\n",
      "It's \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\" via \"Them\" crossed with \"Toy Story\" set in a super hero world.\n",
      "The Motion Picture Academy never recognizes great acting if it comes attached to a costume or a cape. That doesn't mean Downey isn't deserving of an Oscar. It's great acting in a great film.\n",
      "...for that first hour, Endgame is maybe the most radical superhero film since Logan...\n",
      "A classic comic-book hero quest that, while not entirely novel, hews to its own rules and conventions with dignity and artfulness.\n",
      "Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.\n",
      "It's a fun and refreshing change of pace for the MCU, but Shang-Chi falls short of being something great.\n",
      "Coogler's film is a visual masterpiece and also very impactful. Boasted by a phenomenal cast, it's easily the best Marvel film to date.\n",
      "A Marvel movie hasn't been this much fun to watch since the Avengers assembled.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming rightly pulls back on the grandeur and delivers a fresh, sharp, and down-right wonderful piece of popcorn cinema.\n",
      "From the bongo-heavy heist music, to the deft sight gags, to little details like the scratches Scott Lang leaves while he's tiny, there's no shortage of great stuff to see and enjoy - no magnifying glass required.\n",
      "...the right kind of patriotic (the kind that doesn't demean other cultures) and the right shade of nostalgia...\n",
      "It is often vastly entertaining and there is plenty of whizz-bang fun in a film that feels like a bumper edition of classic sci-fi TV - a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.\n",
      "The best debut for a Marvel franchise since 'Iron Man.'\n",
      "You know things are pretty damn serious when Captain America starts swearing.\n",
      "A somewhat subversive piece of work, one that finds hilarity in fake catastrophes and in our very need to imagine the noisiest worst-case scenarios.\n",
      "Film predstavlja predobru kombinaciju akcije, drame i humora da bi ga se otpisalo kao rutinersko holivudsko eksploatiranje devete umjetnosti\n",
      "Diversity & fluidity is a plus, but Chloe Zhao's influence is absent in this team forms-breaks up-reforms retread, & it unfolds slower than an 8-room canvas tent. Bollywood!\n",
      "Doctor Strange is all about the razzle-dazzle, where spectacle elements are good enough to save a more clunky, weightless Marvel origin story.\n",
      "...make no mistake, this movie plays like a third \"Avengers\" film hidden within the thin, sub-hero veneer.\n",
      "A thrilling, fun and exhilarating slice of mindless entertainment.\n",
      "Thor has always been the most laughable of the Avengers, and Waititi's approach means we don't have to pretend to take seriously the insane mythology about outer space Vikings ruling over nine galactic realms.\n",
      "We've waited for Black Panther for a long time, and it delivers on Every. Single. Level.\n",
      "The picture's great achievement is the adept balancing of so many characters. It never feels overstuffed and everyone has their moment and purpose while several new heroes are introduced.\n",
      "I cheered so hard. There are some scenes...prepare yourself. This movie made me feel whole.\n",
      "If there's a risk of the Marvel 'formula' becoming stale, there isn't any evidence of that here. Civil War isn't just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn't offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward.\n",
      "It's the closest to \"The Matrix\" the MCU has ever come, and \"Far From Home\" is the first Marvel film to hold a mirror up to the audience watching in theaters.\n",
      "Coogler has brought off something impressive here: he's made one of the few halfway watchable Marvel movies and returned the comic strip to the streets where it belongs.\n",
      "The melancholy of Avengers: Endgame will last in the fans' emotional memory. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "To see Endgame with a crowd is to remember what moviegoing once was and still can be: a group experience of grief and joy. It's a reason to assemble.\n",
      "Despite numerous, potentially dangerous traps, the film always remains conscious of its pop-cultural vibe and handles it skillfully.\n",
      "An uneven but passionate and energetic introduction for a figure some have called the most powerful hero in the MCU.\n",
      "Chloé Zhao presents some of the biggest strengths of Eternals with her direction, but also some of its biggest weaknesses with her writing.\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War may look as if it's made from and operate as if it's beholden to the mold of the regular, old superhero movie, but it doesn't feel that way.\n",
      "Stories come in all shapes and sizes and \"Ant-Man And The Wasp\" proves not all their superhero movies need to be blockbusters about saving the world.\n",
      "The movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits. The nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a follow-up sequel.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is a nice lighthearted breather from recent devastating MCU events; this isn't the first time Ant-Man has had a tough act to follow, and judging from this sequel, it won't be the last, as the successful levity is welcome\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame goes to great lengths to deliver what its fanbase expects: big battles with cosmic stakes, a bit of self-deprecation and a plethora of superheroes that are happily and reverentially showcased.\n",
      "While the intricacies of the mystical world can be confusing at times, our introduction to this side of the Marvel Universe makes for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience, thanks to dazzling 3-D visual effects.\n",
      "\"It feels like the lead up to Yellowjacket was all cut out. I hope that's the case. Honestly, I expected him to say 'mwahaha' at one point.\"\n",
      "The worst thing about Thor: Ragnarok is just how much of this wild ride has already been given away freely in the film's successful marketing material.\n",
      "Captain America: The Winter Soldier neatly and entertainingly puts into motion some big changes in the Marvel universe, while still sticking to its own charms - no easy feat, but one fit for a hero.\n",
      "Polished, tart and smart, Iron Man 3 buffs up to an entertaining, subversive two hours that enjoys supplying rugs simply to pull them from under the audience's expectations.\n",
      "We get the lowdown on Budapest, albeit without a hearty bowl of goulash. Anyway, this cloak-and-dagger story somewhat satisfies.\n",
      "Eternals represents the kind of grand, open-hearted home run swings that Hollywood should be more willing to embrace.\n",
      "Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful, moving, and thematically resonant films to date. It's also one of its most uneven, when all is said and done.\n",
      "A beautiful new entry in the MCU\n",
      "It's revealing that after 22 movies packed with action and fantasy, the franchise chose to end its narrative with a small moment of intimacy and sweetness. [Full review in Portuguese]\n",
      "The best part of this second film (more will come) is also the worst: it looks too much like the original. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.\n",
      "Cheerfully (and fittingly) small in scale, with personal stakes rather than fate-of-the-world stuff and a director who doesn't pretend it's anything more than that.\n",
      "It was always a bit touch and go just how Marvel would recover from the events of Infinity War and wrap up the stories of beloved heroes which we've been following for years, but they've done an impressive job which will leave fans entirely satisfied.\n",
      "If you've survived all the cliffhangers Marvel has tossed about in its awesome masterplan; pray tell, what happens after the dust has settled? It's epic. Quite somber, but epic.\n",
      "Marvel makes it funny, and that charm and care is what has and will keep audiences coming back over and over again.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 taps into that childlike glee that comes with sitting in a dark movie theater, ready to see favorite characters travel worlds and fight off aliens.\n",
      "a bombast of kinetic otherworldly action, over-the-top characters, and ceaseless jocularity\n",
      "While it's certainly an odd time to choose to tell this story, that doesn't stop it from being another solid entry in the MCU. The story is smaller, darker, and more personal, and features several standout new characters.\n",
      "Based on yet another Marvel series, Iron Man has plenty of things going for it, the main assets being an enjoyably sardonic Downey, his hardware, and the downturned mouth of his new metal visage - a warning that this self-styled messiah means business.\n",
      "Une production à grand déploiement exécutant une formule bien établie, mais avec un savoir-faire indéniable et un enthousiasme contagieux\n",
      "A film that is equal parts grand finale and promises more of the same with a different coat of paint. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "These films no longer have to delight and surprise us; no, their job now is to manage the brand, not screw anything up too royally, and keep us hooked for the next installment. Civil War pulls all that off mostly well.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame represents a remarkable achievement.\n",
      "It never abandons the sense of humor, fun characters, and wonderful chemistry between Tom Holland and Zendaya, as well as correctly balancing adventure, romance, and action. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "There is a sense here though that the MCU formula is now being relied upon to paper over some of the cracks in the storytelling.\n",
      "It's honestly a little hard to separate Ant-Man and the Wasp's actual quality from what a lovely break it is from reality.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is a two-hour mental break when a lot of people could need a mental break.... I mean this as a huge compliment.\n",
      "Marvel-ous!\n",
      "'Thor: The Dark World' is everything I want out of a movie starring a handsome God in a red cape.\n",
      "James Gunn succeeds at turning a relatively familiar and kinda dumb story into an impressively emotional and satisfying journey.\n",
      "It's a mostly successful and visually dazzling introduction for the wizard, who fits in comfortably with the ongoing brand name world-building, making him a welcomingly oddball avenger.\n",
      "You'll never see a victory lap look quite as awesome as this one.\n",
      "It mixes melancholy with violence and humour, styles clashing, the artsy vs. the \"Marvel way,\" with cartoonish digital creations and all. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "... The fact that \"Age of Ultron\" succeeds at all, even if not to the extent of \"The Avengers,\" is a major achievement.\n",
      "A terrible, horrible, no good, very bad thought occurred to me about halfway through Doctor Strange. You guys, what if Benedict Cumberbatch isn't a very good actor?\n",
      "Performances are fine; Hopkins is an imposing Odin and Chris Hemsworth is obviously on his way to real stardom with this.\n",
      "As this summer's glut of superhero movies goes, let's just say that it's no X-Men: First Class but at least it's more enjoyably goofy than Thor.\n",
      "Thanos packs a heck of a punch in \"Infinity War\" - he pretty much punches everyone. It's the emotion behind those punches that will surprise you.\n",
      "An origin story for the character - aka Natasha Romanoff, a spy-turned-Avenger - it is slightly above average for a Marvel movie. That also makes it above average in terms of Hollywood blockbusters.\n",
      "Audiences seem to be smart enough these days to know a good movie when they see it, and to avoid a bad flick despite Hollywood's best efforts to pull a fast one on them.\n",
      "For a franchise so defined by its hulking he-man central figure, there is very little meat on the bone in Thor: The Dark World.\n",
      "Whatever pops up on screen seems to work, making this a keeper comic book film.\n",
      "Doctor Strange might have a lot of baggage, but more than anything else, it's fun.\n",
      "Pleasingly old-school, Thor: The Dark World has a greater kinship with the science-fiction movies of the 1950s or even the first Star Wars cycle than the more earthbound adventures of Tony Stark and the rest of Thor's fellow Avengers.\n",
      "The rest of this romp, however, is as light and frothy as superhero movies-or buddy comedies-come.\n",
      "With Chris Evans charismatic as ever in the lead, and a good supporting cast, The Winter Soldier is a welcome addition to Marvel's ever-expanding canon.\n",
      "Far from Home is an old-fashioned adventure with cutting-edge cinematic razzmatazz that charms throughout thanks to strong performances, picture-postcard locations and an overarching sense of joy.\n",
      "Don't let the goatee fool you - this is no Iron Man.\n",
      "Hugely entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.\n",
      "Although Larson's heroine is still a work in progress, \"Captain Marvel\" lays a solid foundation to follow her wherever she flies next.\n",
      "Engaging, entertaining and empowering, this new and terrific iteration spotlights a strong, complex, fearless woman finding her voice, power and place in the universe.\n",
      "Despite all the advance hype preceding its release, Captain America, yet another 3-D Marvel Comics concoction, straggles onto the screen with little reason to exist except as a marketing machine.\n",
      "The depth of feeling helps counter the choppy storytelling in this new tangent in the MCU narrative.\n",
      "There are a few scenes in Iron Man that make you realize why we rely on giant studios and big budgets come the summer months.\n",
      "Director Cate Shortland has a sharp eye for directing action sequences, but the script is flawed.\n",
      "A high quality, incredibly entertaining, joyous summer event. If I was 12, it would be my favorite movie ever made.\n",
      "It's a summer blockbuster worthy of the moniker.\n",
      "It is not often creative ambition and actual execution rise together to such atmospheric heights.\n",
      "Rudd's charm and easygoing sense of humor keeps us engaged, even though 'Ant-Man' is the least clever and ambitious of the recent spate of Marvel movies.\n",
      "...doesn't have the emotional involvement of the best of sci-fi action films, but it's a thrashing good big dipper ride and the 3D actually works...\n",
      "Doctor Strange has all the strengths of a Marvel movie-a well-told story, a well-tuned sense of humor about itself, a personal drama to shape the hero's journey-as well as all the weaknesses (conventions of a superhero origin tale are getting repetitive).\n",
      "Half the living beings in the universe aren't at stake, just two lives. If you're ok with that after Infinity War, then this is the perfect superhero summer blockbuster palate cleanser.\n",
      "Technically, the film is excellent, with seamless CGI, and top-notch performances throughout, though moments are dark (literally, squinting-to-see dark).\n",
      "Normally I'm inclined to not see comic-book movies in the first place, but this is one I'd like to see a second time.\n",
      "It's just the hit-after-hit of firecracker gags of sight and of speech undermine [Cate] Blanchett's efforts to make Hela sensual-yet-deadly, charismatic-yet-wily.\n",
      "Like its scruffy crew, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an affable and harmless way to spend a few hours.\n",
      "Downey Jr. makes it all worthwhile.\n",
      "Rest easy fans, Marvel have delivered... again.\n",
      "Like the array of beloved '70s and '80s tunes peppered throughout the soundtrack, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome mix of the fresh and the familiar that does the job of priming the pump for another volume.\n",
      "It's something you have to see to believe, and once you see it, you still won't believe it.\n",
      "It achieves a good balance of action and comic relief and-despite a ridiculous set-up-turns out to be a decent family drama on top of all that.\n",
      "Arthurian grandeur, fanboy-pleasing whallop and special-effect razzle-dazzle flesh out the backstory of how the hunky hammerer got from Up There to Down Here.\n",
      "It's a movie that shows the confidence of a blockbuster that knows what it has to do to earn the adoration of its audience. [Full review in Portuguese]\n",
      "Eternals may not be your typical comic book film, but it's a refreshing new vision thanks to Zhao's confident filmmaking.\n",
      "Plenty of humor and action make this an immensely entertaining thrill ride. Captain Marvel is a blast.\n",
      "Captain Marvel lays exciting groundwork for something higher, further, faster.\n",
      "This is a stand alone film that actually stands alone. Captain Marvel may not be subtle or stylistically innovative -- or even particularly great for that matter -- but I'll still be excited to show it to my daughter once she's old enough.\n",
      "It's enjoyable enough. The current critical buzz, about how it starts slow but ends strong, unlike so many other superhero-origin films, is relativism gone slightly mad.\n",
      "It's not a drastic enough change to freak out the faithful or demolish the formula, but it's a pleasant enough experience, and its aesthetic instinct skews toward the pretty and expansive.\n",
      "\"But there's a surprise to Captain Marvel that only her dearest fans likely saw coming-coming into your own is fun.\"\n",
      "A simpler story, more action and some nice visuals make for a satisfying, if not exactly incredible, monster hero sequel.\n",
      "The fans won't be disappointed by the lavish visual effects, the explosions and gun battles, all of which are the essential elements in this kind of super-cinema experience.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World is a bombastic sequel which celebrates everything the first film did well while still not knowing what to do with its poor mortals.\n",
      "Paul Rudd is resourceful, self-deprecating and capable of making the most of the thinnest material.\n",
      "...there aren't many writer-directors as talented as Joss Whedon. Indeed, it's the writing that sets this film apart from the crowd, in harmony with perfect casting, first-rate visual effects, and other key ingredients.\n",
      "Brie Larson was already my hero before Captain Marvel so this only reconfirms the obvious.\n",
      "As Wenwu, Tony Leung Chiu Wai is sensitively framed by director Cretton in a way that emphasises the Hong Kong veteran's most evocative weapon: his eyes.\n",

      "It's a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously - and where to inject the fun.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok prides itself in being outrageously silly resulting in a different kind of superhero film that alters the landscape and has a lot of fun in doing so. It is a spontaneity driven juggernaut that puts the \"comic\" back in \"comical.\"\n",
      "Marvel has known how to introduce a new character and significantly expand the universe in a very effective way. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great.\n",
      "Captain Marvel manages to juggle being several different kinds of films at once, and the balancing act, combined with stellar performances and its unique lead hero, make a film nothing short of a triumph.\n",
      "'Far From Home' has this confidence that's admirable. It gets weird, goofy and keeps you on your toes, which is what you want out of a franchise that has 20-plus movies in it. Go have a blast!\n",
      "Black Panther is a hit! It's emotional, powerful and action packed to satisfy comic book fans as well as newcomers who probably haven't seen a Marvel film, but want to experience seeing Black excellence on the big screen.\n",
      "Whedon delivers enough fun, action, and engaging team banter that fans will exit pleased but perhaps not giddy with joy.\n",
      "It's fine, but you wonder how they can expect you to care about an earth-shattering conclusion when the previous two hours (and 18 movies) were all about these magic stones that can undo anything.\n",
      "For all the good Alan Taylor does in making sure that the sequel stays sure-footed, there's still a nagging feeling left behind that we haven't really seen a Thor film from a director who truly loves the world he's being paid to bring to life.\n",
      "A vivaciously crowd-pleasing space adventure. Of all of Marvel's many Phase I and Phase II projects tackled, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is, to date, the most alive with imagination and wonder.\n",
      "Surprisingly smaller-scale and lighter than INFINITY WAR, with disappointing action to boot, but it ends on a high note and the key characters get pushed in interesting directions.\n",
      "Black and Downey put a swell spin of wit into it and, in a time of superhero saturation, take a back seat to no one in reserving marquee space for their guy. Moreover, they leave you wanting more of the same, please.\n",
      "Drawing on other genres and incorporating more points of view in the creative process is all the familiar formula needs to feel fresh...\n",
      "Arguably the movie that the previous 12 Marvel adventures have all been working towards\n",
      "Holland is spectacular, proving hilarious and warm throughout his European adventure -- he gets a pretty rad set of costumes too.\n",
      "Despite your standard Marvel action set piece and a colorful cast of characters, Black Widow feels of little consequence, delivering a story that has written itself into a corner with nowhere to go.\n",
      "For all the genius direction and strong screenplay, the memorable supporting performances and top-notch character development, the best part of Spider-Man: Homecoming is the man - or should I say boy - himself.\n",
      "Instead of mailing in a half-hearted origin story ... Joe Johnston went ahead and turned his Captain America film into a rousing period thriller that expands on the Marvel mythology while also working as a standalone summer blockbuster.\n",
      "I had hoped for so much more than what was delivered. The loyal fan base will no doubt think otherwise.\n",
      "it's not just powerful because it's awesome, and it's not just awesome because it's powerful\n",
      "Explosive and highly entertaining.\n",
      "Black Panther is an important movie that doesn't feel like being forced to eat kale, thanks to car chases, shootouts and subtle bursts of humor.\n",
      "The outcome satisfyingly tops the trip and resonates long after you leave the theater. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The recent ending of the Infinity saga and everything that went with is so large that Far From Home is more of a statement on that than anything else, leaving its main character to tag a long after his class and after his story.\n",
      "Ant-Man may have a hero who is often small, but the movie is always big fun.\n",
      "A movie that could have been bold and iconic, but instead settles for good enough.\n",

      "It's not only the best Spider-Man movie -- it's one of the best films in Marvel's cinematic universe.\n",
      "An exhilarating delight-a tongue-in-cheek, big-budget sci-fi blockbuster that could easily be this generation's Star Wars.\n",
      "It functions well as a comedy, and light hearted fantasy, while channeling the spirit of classic Marvel tropes of the underdog, redemption, and the construction of an avenger.\n",
      "Robert Redford, laying aside Mr Liberal Sundance Nice Guy, lends sleek mischief to a dodgy Washington power-broker. Elsewhere, it's the box-office blend as before.\n",
      "As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own.\n",
      "There's something new in \"Avengers Endgame.\" Real stakes. Also, real warmth, zest and a real sense of family connection.\n",
      "It is lighter and less pyrotechnic, more friendly and entertaining than other Marvel products. [full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Rather than bang us over the head with that hammer, Hemsworth and Kenneth Branagh take a mischievous, light-hearted approach more in keeping with the Marvel Comic than the ancient mythology.\n",
      "In this latest movie in the MCU (directed by Jon Watt), Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is living in a post \"Endgame\" world, which is proving to be more difficult than he anticipated.\n",
      "Better than it has any right to be, this post-apocalyptic superhero film has significantly more merits than demerits.\n",
      "Black Panther is to the ongoing Marvel project as Coogler's Creed was to the Rocky movies - a film simultaneously beholden to its franchise and alive to every possibility within it, creating a new world within the existing master narrative.\n",
      "The picture would be worth seeing just to watch Tony Leung command the screen every minute he's on it.\n",
      "This film's message is all about empowering women. It's almost as if every single scene is a conduit for positive female thinking.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming is smart, incredibly funny and surprisingly clever. It is an entirely unexpected - perhaps even vanishingly implausible - fresh start for the third Spider-Man franchise of the past fifteen years.\n",
      "Iron Man is the first blockbuster movie of the summer, and, despite the topical Taleban atrocities, it's a roaring fairground ride.\n",
      "So, much to my surprise, I liked this, even at three hours.\n",
      "I fear for the sequel, as I do for all Marvel sequels, because so often they're about delivering another round of the expected. But \"Shang-Chi\" may succeed there, too. It certainly succeeds here.\n",
      "He has a big hammer, and he knows how to swing it.\n",
      "Like \"Wonder Woman\" last year, \"Black Panther\" is a project that fans have been waiting decades to see. And just like \"Wonder Woman,\" it was worth the wait.\n",
      "Either IM3 is a Marvel movie in the guise of a Shane Black action-comedy or the other way around. Regardless, it's an awful lot of fun.\n",
      "Comic book fans are likely to appreciate Captain America, which does a good job of consolidating the disparate origin aspects of the character into something easily digestible.\n",
      "Marvel's grand plan turned out to be a good one. This is a hugely entertaining time at the movies.\n",
      "Proud postures alternate with callbacks and climaxes and sniffly tear-tugs and lots of that wacky, weightless Marvel verbal humor... telegraphic jolts of joy for those who [ingested] the prior 2,299 minutes of the \"Universe\" entire.\n",
      "'Avengers: Infinity War' is a great entertainment that includes a remarkable amount of amazing scenes, but it doesn't finish hitting the target for small details. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "The look and feel of the film is mesmerizing, but perhaps what's even more captivating are the performances by this outstanding cast.\n",
      "The cast is better than solid. Directed by Peyton Reed, the action is a zippy pleasure. The more Scott shrinks, the bigger the fun. The visual effects are witty, especially when he begins making allies of various ant colonies.\n",
      "Norse nonsense, but great fun.\n",
      "If we can continue to get movies as good as Captain America: Civil War, comic book adaptations are not a bubble about to burst; we're entering a golden age where everything is firing on all cylinders\n",
      "When the film's true nature is revealed, it's compelling, thought-provoking stuff.\n",
      "The chemistry between these two fantastic actors [Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh] is stunning, and Pugh is a perfect addition to the MCU.\n",
      "Joss Whedon and his heroes and villains epic offers more this time around -- more characters, more plot points, more action -- and a few reasons for concern.\n",
      "[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man.\n",
      "A film with beautiful visuals, impressive directing and great character dynamics, Thor Ragnarok is one of the better films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "No other movie franchise has created this sort of suspense in one film and resolved it so spectacularly in the next.\n",
      "Matching its blockbuster scale and spectacle with the smarts of a great, grown-up thriller, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios' finest film yet.\n",
      "\"At times it will leave you in awe of what you're watching unfold in front of your eyes.\"\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is merry and fleet, and no less enjoyable for being instantly forgettable. The buzz might be temporary, but it's fun while it lasts.\n",
      "Captain Marvel offers its audiences a chance for escapism, and to imagine a world in which one woman can change the course of the future.\n",
      "As it arrives poised for a megalithic box-office haul, it might be helpful to keep in mind the advice offered by one character: \"You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?\"\n",
      "It boasts the best of Marvel's knowing wit and and one-liners, the grandest flex of its big-dollar action muscle, and crucially, some of the boldest plot developments yet seen in its cinematic canon.\n",
      "It's too long and it lags a bit in spots, but overall there is still a lot of fun to be had here.\n",
      "A perfectly enjoyable exercise in superheroics, and much more fun to watch than 'Man of Steel'.\n",
      "Marvel's familiar formula with some really cool visuals.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World is a wildly entertaining continuation of Marvel's dominance of the big budget action blockbuster genre, and a savvy revisit of its most difficult and ambitious piece of character mythology.\n",
      "BLACK PANTHER is an incredible and important moment that will mean very much to very many, and is, at its core, simply a great time at the movies, with the potential to be even more in well-deserved sequels.\n",
      "Marvel Studios provides yet another captivating film, but its lasting impact will be far less than pretty much every other entry into the MCU.\n",
      "[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on \"Age of Ultron,\" he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's \"The Avengers.\"\n",
      "It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The best thing Gunn has going for him is that even when he gets off the best beat for the movie, his cast is so talented and breathes so much life into their roles that they can cover up any small dark holes in this Galaxy.\n",
      "Now we have Captain America: Civil War, a film in which every single character decision is deeply personal, deeply emotional.\n",
      "Holland's webslinger is easily Civil War's best surprise. He projects a genuine sense of awe and wonder in the presence of the other heroes.\n",
      "Even without the franchise best production design, costumes, cinematography, and effects, \"Black Panther\" has a compelling story at its heart that makes both heroes and villains relatable.\n",
      "As the MCU only continues to expand, Cretton's film should be pointed to as a sterling example of what's possible when a hero is allowed to be his own man, on his own terms.\n",
      "The usual winks and snarks from Tony Stark, but this edition feels fresher and funnier, thanks to writer- director Shane Black.\n",
      "Beneath its comic-book action trappings, the film is about Captain America's loss of innocence. He's 93 years old, and he comes of age.\n",
      "The Guardians series continues well here in Vol. 2, giving viewers more of what they expect in the unexpected.\n",
      "The film pushes back against the usual complaints offered up by those who harbor a performative disdain for Marvel's cinematic output.\n",
      "If you're a Marvel fan, enjoy action adventure/martial arts, appreciate production design...and costumes that more than please the eye, or want to be entertained, this marvelous spectacle, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings will enthrall.\n",
      "At its best - and \"Endgame\" is in some ways as good as it gets - the \"Avengers\" cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place.\n",
      "Just another rote space adventure. It's not actively awful, but there isn't a single damn thing in the least bit surprising or memorable about it.\n",
      "A spy-centric, timely, intriguing thriller.\n",
      "An endearing throwback to simpler times: when men were men, gods were gods and heroes looked like bodybuilders who'd just raided the dress-up box. Just don't expect to remember much about it afterwards.\n",
      "Despite some starchy Louisiana heartland sequences, this is an effective fantasy of power used with grace and without arrogance.\n",
      "Like its monstrous hero, The Incredible Hulk gets the job done with minimal artistry and a lot of noise.\n",
      "Black Panther is a study in how to use comic-based material to do something that is both very entertaining and very heady.\n",
      "Simu Liu is perfect as Shang-Chi. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Like the first film, what makes the sequel work is how director Joss Whedon builds the action on this character foundation and injects it with just enough humor to make its personality radiate.\n",
      "It's the snappy dialogue, appealing, broadly drawn characters, and imaginative use of the shrinking gimmick that make Ant-Man stand out.\n",
      "Shang-Chi doesn't reinvent the wheel but shows us the peak of the MCU.\n",
      "All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and for every laugh there are other things happening to balance it all out.\n",
      "Doctor Strange is basically a reboot of Iron Man, only with a lot more prettier things to look at while you're stoned. It's a good strategy. And it works.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp blends the superhero film with comedy without feeling disjointed. More jokes landed than in most films of this combination of genres, which makes this more like a superhero comedy than a superhero film with comedic relief.\n",
      "A film in which the minuscule can quickly become monumental.\n",
      "Despite the comic-book origins of the tale, the stakes feel real, with some powerful moments of sacrifice, and a few wistful reunions.\n",
      "This Spider-Man film is undoubtedly the funniest Marvel product since Avengers Assemble, and mercifully we don't have to go through another origins plot.\n",

      "It's wider in scope than the first effort but just as funny.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok is a triumph and with a story boasting plenty of laughs, action and, perhaps most importantly, heart, this threequel is another winner for Marvel Studios.\n",
      "All in all, \"Doctor Strange\" is a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics.\n",
      "The screenplay does an exceptional job of incorporating this film into the pre-existing and percolating Marvel cinematic universe.\n",
      "The film could not have come at a better time. And it does something incredibly important: it allows black artists the opportunity to be front and centre in the telling of stories about black people.\n",
      "There is genuine comic firepower here, and a script that keeps on serving up great moments for the cast to chew on.\n",
      "By Friday night, anyone who has seen this first \"Guardians\" will be speaking volumes about all its future possibilities, especially big-name actors scampering to hop aboard for a potentially huge and long franchise ride.\n",
      "A high-octane, silver screen mash-up that finally gets going after the best part of its 143-minute running time.\n",
      "The \"civil war\" that erupts among Avengers foments filmmaking invention, not anarchy. It harks back to a comic-book tradition that predates the Avengers.\n",
      "Creating a script that not only lives up to the hype, but fulfills and even exceeds the expectations of fans is no easy task, but Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn have done so - and in a manner that does not give short shrift to any of the major characters.\n",
      "A spectacular, once-in-a-lifetime epic. Avengers, dismissed.\n",
      "Iron Man kicks off summer on a blazing high note and practically dares the competition to measure up.\n",
      "The Marvel movie machine puts another second-string superhero on the A-list.\n",
      "You're hit with how visually stunning this damn movie is. I'm tempted to go back and watch in IMAX or 3D.\n",
      "Overall, Civil War is the most adult and realized film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it comes highly recommended.\n",
      "Ant-Man is at least entertaining without overwhelming, and funny without the pomposity of the recent Marvel onslaught.\n",
      "A new kick-ass heroine, a cat called Goose and Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury are the best things about this spectacular action-packed adventure from the Marvel cinematic universe.\n",
      "The Avengers will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly.\n",
      "While Black Widow was an entertaining and enjoyable spy thriller, it felt less about Natasha and her story, and more about her sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh).\n",
      "A story of diversity, family and compassion, Black Panther roars onto the screen at a million miles an hour.\n",
      "It doesn't always work, but it is undeniably the most ambitious Marvel movie (and it didn't need 25 other movies as stepping stones to a colossal-length grand finale), pitting religious and familial duties against one another\n",
      "It might lack the freshness of part one - which, quite frankly, is almost impossible to reproduce in a sequel - but the heart and humor are fully intact.\n",
      "It all escalates into a group showdown that's gloriously fun and genuinely sad, because if you've made it through eight years of Marvel features, you care about these quippy oddballs and their imperfect alliance.\n",
      "A doozy of a story packed with visual surrealism and clever plot surprises.\n",
      "Welcome home, Spidey.\n",
      "These flourishes keep Ant-Man and the Wasp light on its feet...and it doubles down on the first film's fathers-and-daughters themes to moderately heart-warming effect.\n",
      "[It] entertains here, surprises there, and on the whole a clear improvement over 2011's The First Avenger.\n",
      "We come for the eye-popping visuals and the snarky humor, but we're touched by the emotional ties of the characters...\n",
      "...a story that can only be about a woman, about her frustrations and setbacks and the way the world works against her, and what happens when she stops trying to work with the world and just does her own thing.\n",
      "BLACK WIDOW is a very good distraction from the everyday woes people might have.\n",
      "[O]ne of the most ambitious, entertaining, emotional, and stunning blockbusters we've ever seen, and the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon thus far.\n",
      "Marvel Studios' answer to 'The Dark Knight' is tremendously entertaining and likely the superhero blockbuster to beat not just for 2014, but possibly many years to come.\n",
      "A great international thriller, it engages the world at large yet stays focused as a sharp cast led by Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford support the star-spangled main man.\n",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio is a scene-stealer in this highly enjoyable Spidey sequel. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "No one can quibble with the efforts of the actors. Marvel cast well, and continues to expand their parts or add fascinating new players.\n",
      "Black Panther distinguishes itself from other Marvel movies by granting its characters deep-seated motivations that extend past borders and generations.\n",
      "Larson's energy makes Captain Marvel, whether she's pummeling villains with her self-satisfied smirk or radiating light in space like a blazing spectre.\n",
      "Whedon weaves theses titanic characters and egos together to bind the bloated universe into a Long Island Iced Tea; the more you savour, the more you come to appreciate all the powerful and seemingly conflicting elements and motivations working together.\n",
      "It's both nowhere near as bad as the Rotten Tomatoes discourse would have you believe and also nowhere near as exemplary as the rabid fan base's dogmatic defenses online may have warranted.\n",
      "There are horror movies and political dramas with premises less nightmarish than the one in \"Avengers: Endgame... This is an interesting approach for a superhero film to take.\n",
      "The whole time watching the film, I wanted to spend more time with its hero.\n",
      "It's an epic franchise finale that cuts straight to the heart of what it means to rise from the ashes of defeat.\n",
      "A n exceptionally well-made, incredibly entertaining and -- dare I say it -- marvelous superhero movie.\n",
      "... when it comes to action scenes, explosions, destruction and flying pirouettes, Iron Man does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Maybe it's not as original as the first, but it has all the elements to captivate with extravagance and charm. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "This is a film that never loses sight of its title character, even when that character literally falls between the cracks.\n",
      "Although it's been far too long in the making, Scarlett Johansson finally has her time to shine in the solo action-packed spy thriller Black Widow\n",
      "The crazy, tilted world glimpsed in the trailers is one of the most fascinating and immersive comic book-inspired film environments ever created in a live-action movie.\n",

      "This space caper has its head in the clouds and its tongue, firmly in cheek.\n",
      "Edward Norton is a Bill Bixby-kind of guy and this is more faithful to the TV show than the last film, but its still hard to root for a CGI character.\n",

      "This is awful! I'm just kidding...it's really good, and Downey, Jr. is perfect for the part.\n",
      "You might not expect it, but this Kenneth Branagh-helmed comic book movie delivers - thanks to a deftly-balanced tone and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.\n",
      "Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one huuuge gem, and comes closer to achieving truth and realness in its story than any Marvel film has before.\n",
      "It dares to wrestle with big, existential issues, confront some surprisingly grown up questions and take enormous narrative risks.\n",
      "While not without messiness and over-plotting that bogs down and overcomplicates the narrative, Eternals succeeds as a vast and unrepentantly serious bit of world building with a moral quandary at its center.\n",
      "you wait six years for one James Bond movie to arrive and now two are coming along at once\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is disposable pop trash, not worth taking seriously for a moment and therefore eminently worthy of your attention at this moment.\n",

      "Big laughs, small concerns.\n",
      "One could take a magnifying glass to \"Ant-Man,\" but the results would be disastrous. This is a superhero movie to be enjoyed in the moment.\n",
      "In director Jon Watts' hands, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a true comedy. There may be better Spider-Man movies, but there's never been a funnier one, one that avoids the origin story and poor old Uncle Ben.\n",
      "While Endgame never climbs new comic territory like its predecessors and is more often than not sombre and reflective, it is also narratively unlike any MCU film you've ever seen.\n",
      "The film takes what it needs from the MCU and then uses the rest as punchlines. It works! This was a great summer comedy.\n",
      "Even removed from the rest of Marvel's film catalogue, it would still stand as one of the most fun and entertaining blockbusters not just this year but of the past several years.\n",
      "Though uneven and structurally messy, new version is better and more entertaining than Lee's somber take, a summer popcorn movie that favors thrilling action and f/x over plot and characters; it makes you curious to see Norton's longer, more detailed cut.\n",
      "Although the experiment of combining commercial cinema with an indie sensibility doesn't always work, there's a lot worth watching. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Fitfully entertaining, especially the first half, plus a pretty decent villain in Red Skull played by Hugo Weaving, wearing an impressive/scary crimson get-up that looked like it was done through makeup rather than CGI.\n",
      "Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn. Like me.\n",
      "One of the most fun and exciting films of Spiderman that remains in the first place for me because of that classic air of Richard Donner that no longer exists in the current superhero cinema. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "This movie is fine, honestly. I rather liked it.\n",
      "If you've invested years of your life to the MCU [Marvel Cinematic Universe] like I have, this movie will feel like a fan letter to you. Kevin Feige and his team deserve so much praise for being able to pull off something of this magnitude.\n",
      "Whedon knows how to be self-aware without getting overly cute about it. He has fun highlighting each character's neurosis and knows which personalities clash to greatest effect.\n",
      "There's just enough tension and humor in \"Thor: The Dark World\" to make the film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just.\n",
      "Liu is captivating. The Chinese-Canadian star owns every moment he is on screen - which, thankfully, is a lot.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy was an outside-the-box choice by Marvel; a huge gamble that paid off handsomely. It is epic space opera and well-constructed comedy, a visually stunning experience driven by exceptional performances.\n",
      "Puts the 'some' in 'awesome.'\n",
      "Black Power indeed...presents some great role models for an underserved audience while promoting an anti-nationalistic message and that's no small thing.\n",
      "For a movie with a ridiculously unwieldy cast, Infinity War is surprisingly comprehensible and fun.\n",
      "A sequel that more than matches the original's impact.\n",
      "Like the classic rock soundtrack powering this picture, the hits outweigh the misses, yet there are times when one is tempted to press the fast-forward button.\n",
      "A no-nonsense, punchy and fierce introduction to Captain Marvel - Who runs the world? GIRLS!\n",
      "Even with the fate of the entire universe at stake, Derrickson keeps the tone appealingly light and jokey, and Cumberbatch's Strange isn't so cynical that he can't thrill at discovering his spectacular capabilities ...\n",
      "But Captain Marvel succeeds where it is most needed. It injects a truly badass superheroine played by an overjoyed Larson into the MCU.\n",
      "A superhero movie that raises key questions about the responsibilities of a nation to the rest of the world.\n",
      "This eye-popping spectacle is remarkably dazzling, uproarious and unadulterated fun that exceeds all expectations.\n",
      "Ant-Man does some things very well, like letting Paul Rudd inhabit a comic-book character in precisely the same way Iron Man put a goatee on Robert Downey Jr. and called him Tony Stark.\n",
      "Against all odds, the studio has yet another elegant, extremely entertaining winner on its hands.\n",
      "Ebulliently funny, visually inventive, and above all passionately committed to the idea that heroism isn't a burden but an uplifting realization of our best qualities.\n",
      "While many Marvel films feel like small pieces of a larger story, Black Panther is an entire cinematic universe unto itself.\n",
      "Let's just hope that Avengers: Endgame follows through on something Carol Danvers asks herself: \"what happens when I am finally set free\"? Yeah, you're kind of screwed Thanos\n",
      "Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, in places both old and new, we get to witness some of the most beautiful and awe inspiring images the directors (and the entire MCU) have delivered to date.\n",
      "There are a lot of players in this film but it never really feels like it's too crowded. It's just crowded enough to be an enjoyable film.\n",
      "Black Panther's failures, like its triumphs, are more Shakespearean than superheroic.\n",
      "I definitely enjoyed it, although there was this sense of Avengers bleeding into it. But it was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly.\n",
      "... A wild ride, using visual effects to play with size and scale in absurd and exciting ways.\n",
      "With Jon Favreau, director of the previous Iron Man films, still around in his sidekick role as Happy Hogan, continuity is maintained, but Black does bring his own, mostly comic chops to the saga.\n",
      "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has plenty of heart and adventurous spirit to satisfy superhero movie fans. It's too bad that the title character has a personality that's duller than the average Marvel superhero.\n",
      "[Doctor Strange] may be the most visually stunning entry into the MCU pantheon so far.\n",
      "bounds with buoyant irreverence and serious suspense. The scale is large, the payoffs larger, and the sense of fun is never too far from the angst and anguish Stark endures between quips and feats of derring-do.\n",
      "Marvel has finally started to figure out what the future of superhero movies might look like.\n",
      "Still funny and fun, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome return for our oddball heroes but it is a far more traditional comic book movie than the irreverent original.\n",
      "Purposeful chaos with a sleek finesse.\n",
      "It was exactly what it needed to be and nothing more.\n",
      "The intoxicatingly strange brew - the third \"Thor\" flick, and fifth Marvel film that the Norse god has appeared in - gets nicely stirred by quirky New Zealand auteur Taika Waititi...\n",
      "It misses the bar of classic movie greatness but Avengers: Age of Ultron is one of the most exciting and entertaining Marvel entries.\n",
      "It's Marvel doing what Marvel does, but getting almost everything right this time - and that's rare.\n",
      "The Incredible Hulk is a more-than-serviceable fantasy film ... But on the sliding scale of recent superhero flicks, it falls a bit short.\n",
      "Robert Downey Jr., plays Stark with a twinkle in his eye and a sense of fun, but can't quite stamp the same authority onto the film as he did in the first version.\n",
      "I walked out of the theater feeling like the survivor of an all-you-can-eat buffet.\n",
      "Dumb fun. But the first \"Thor\" movie to look like they threw serious money at it.\n",
      "21 Marvel films to get our first female-led offering was an unforgivable delay, especially for something that plays it so safe.\n",
      "A wonderful fantasy epic and one that can stand alone and attach to the Marvel onslaught of superhero cinematic entries storming theaters...\n",
      "A solid coming of age tale about accepting your past while forging your own path forward that features some downright stellar set pieces -- true MCU standouts.\n",
      "Despite being more traditional in structure and theme than the original, Iron Man 2 offers just about everything anyone could ask for in a superhero spectacular, and then some.\n",
      "Age of Ultron knew to keep a good thing going and I am happy to report that this film is honestly really funny too.\n",
      "Loads of action, humor, and political commentary\n",
      "I'm no comic or Marvel fanboy, but this is magnificent and wondrous entertainment.\n",
      "The action scenes lack the fizz of the character moments ... still, there's enough good stuff here to place this in the upper tier of movies about guys in long underwear.\n",
      "The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 blasts it way onto the big screen with just the right blend of explosions, banter, bullets and superhero shenanigans to prove that there is still plenty of life left in this metallic hero.\n",
      "The funniest part of Ant-Man and the Wasp is the fact Marvel followed their despairing Avengers: Infinity War cliffhanger with a disposable side-adventure. Are they having a laugh? Yes, and loving it.\n",
      "The visuals are breathtaking without it, all swirling cosmic nebulae and mythic cityscapes of the Norse-god capital Asgard.\n",
      "A boisterous, bustling spectacle that attempts to balance the onslaught of special-effects wizardry with some welcome touches of humour and humanity.\n",
      "Even when mindless digital mayhem threatens to swamp the movie, there's always a complex narrative point.\n",
      "Director Jon Watts gives the iconic web-slinging character a heartfelt story, in what is easily the best written film of the Marvel MCU (::gasp:: villain included) yet.\n",
      "The film's otherworldly quality and excellent comedic moments brings to mind Guardians Of The Galaxy in terms of its inventiveness, bringing us a fresher, stranger (I'm sorry. It's right there!) version of the Marvel films we know and love.\n",
      "Achieves something more than just a competent wrangling of diverse comic book stories: it manages to keep Hollywood egos in check\n",
      "We get just about the right amount of science-speak and emotional longing from Banner and Betty between brawls.\n",
      "Despite a somewhat slow start and occasional plot missteps, Iron Man 3 ultimately soars thanks to its charismatic leading man and director Shane Black's man-on-wire balancing act of humor and action.\n",
      "For most of its running time Vol. 2 feels low stakes, but boy is that a welcome change.\n",
      "Doctor Strange breaks new ground from everything so far (in the Marvel Cinematic Universe)...new dimensions even. What a trip!\n",
      "A gorgeous-looking movie, especially in 3D.\n",
      "Black Panther perfects what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always done so well: build a world so richly rendered, it's almost a letdown to reach the end of the film and realize it's time to return to our own reality.\n",
      "I hope people notice how much drama Coogler got out of Black Panther the way they notice Thor: Ragnarok is so funny.\n",
      "The emphasis is clearly on having fun, as the laughs fly as thick and fast as some of Spidey's webs, providing a crowd-pleasing adventure that only really delivers its biggest emotional hits late on.\n",
      "After the formulaic thrills of The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, Marvel's Avengers were in danger of getting stuck in a rut, but a smart script for this surprisingly focussed thriller kicks everything into a new direction.\n",
      "Ant-Man and The Wasp is a fun little movie that is much more focused on the lives of its characters than world-ending events, and it's better for it.\n",
      "A much better film than its 2011 predecessor, embracing its fantasy roots with exciting, entertaining results.\n",
      "The conclusion of Infinity War is so shocking because it doesn't feel like a cliffhanger, more like a drastic wiping clean of the slate before the whole cycle starts again, with whatever reversal of fortune or comprehensive reboot it may be.\n",
      "Marvel hasn't made a movie this fun - this bright, this charming, this joyful -- since the first Iron Man, in which Robert Downey Jr.'s entitled smirk was its most lethal weapon.\n",
      "Heroes can ascend into the galaxy in a Heart t-shirt, too, a star-child in a fitted leather jacket.\n",
      "As it dutifully marches toward its special-effects-driven conclusion, Ant-Man has enough charm to be engaging if not particularly memorable once the end credits roll\n",
      "Hawkeye makes a self-aware remark that none of this makes any sense, and you know what, he's right. There's also nothing to be ashamed of; at the end of the day it's grand fun\n",
      "It's not literature like Lord of the Rings, but in its own way, it's pretty damn impactful.\n",
      "The ending battle between The Hulk and Abomination is one of the most spectacular and exciting things I've ever seen on screen. If the downtown Los Angeles robot battles of Transformers impressed you, this puts those to shame.\n",
      "Though the blammo action stuff is a little stale, Scarlett Johansson finally gets a chance to shoulder her way past the \"big Avenger\" boys and show subtler shadings for her superspy.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 builds on the first movie's strong foundation, with a friendly cast -- notably Pratt, Bautista and Saldana -- and fun action sequences. It's good enough to make a fan look forward to Vol. 3.\n",
      "At times on par with the first Spider-Man, some of the original movie's problems are replaced by new ones, but none that completely ruin the enjoyment every time the Hulk comes out to 'SMASH!!!'\n",
      "This imbued Infinity War with a heart that many of the other films lack. Perhaps most visible is the way in which parenthood and love comes roaring into the MCU.\n",
      "Fails to resolve the fascist implications of Stark's claim to have 'privatized world peace'; here, Stark's human and machine sides correlate to Klaatu and Gort in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' who demanded the world accept a robot police force...\n",
      "A film that's overlong and overstuffed but somehow avoids being a chore to watch.\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War is one of the best superhero movies out there because it dares to break the formula. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The film does stand on it's own two feet, thanks mainly to Norton who should have demanded having Banner run a little more, and Hulk smash a little less.\n",
      "The third outing for the Marvel Comics superhero has standout performances from Robert Downey Jr and Ben Kingsley.\n",
      "As a superhero film Black Panther is fine entertainment that dutifully hits all the beats it is supposed to. Beyond that, anyone willing to decode the film as some sort of sophisticated allegory about black rights might find themselves tied up in knots.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp may be light fare when compared to the other Marvel films, but just like its predecessor, it still manages to pack a pretty big punch where it counts.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Far From Home is jam-packed with action from the very beginning along with plenty of humour and surprises along the way.\n",
      "Far from Home offers an empathetic continuation of Peter's establishment in his first solo outing as a regular kid who wants to be a hero.\n",
      "Coogler's script ... populates the film with some of the most fun and interesting characters in the Marvel series to date.\n",
      "Marvel lays it all on the table for their latest super nova'd blockbuster Avengers Infinity War and then ruthlessly wipes it off clean.\n",
      "The action sequences meet, but do not exceed, the industry standard.\n",
      "[...] The Winter Soldier smartly integrates a crisply orchestrated Marvel action movie with the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, which were pegged to a mistrust of government and the shadow organizations that orbit it.\n",
      "Tropes be damned, Zhao carves out unexpectedly human immortals who actually care about each other. They love and hate and fight and forgive and feud and feel together. It's a refreshingly emotional take.\n",
      "It's fantastic to see a superhero movie getting away from the navel-gazing to serve up overboard action with a knowing sense of humour.\n",
      "With great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Kingsley, this superhero adventure is a blast and a thrilling kick off to the summer of 2013.\n",
      "Those who wait through all of the credits will get a glimpse of what is in store for the next superhero saga. I hope between now and then they remember that less is more.\n",
      "It may still move at hectic speed from one gargantuan punch-up to the next, but - under the direction of Joe and Anthony Russo - it's well paced for the sort of extravaganza it is. The all-star parade never becomes a pile-up.\n",
      "Odin strips Thor of his powers and casts him down to Earth. The movie, alas, is compelled to follow.\n",
      "... A total blast, with a sense of adventure and mischievous fun that can make even a movie critic feel like a kid again.\n",
      "Fortunately, returning director Joss Whedon understands how to craft a superhero movie just as well as Marvel knows how to sell one.\n",
      "A worthy addition to the Marvel canon.\n",
      "Watching Spider-Man: Far From Home, I finally realized what was wrong with the MCU Spidey movies...\n",
      "Ant-Man is a super hero heist movie with all sorts of emphasis on super. Rich characters, a formidable villain, and fun references to the wider Marvel Universe make Ant-Man one of Marvel's biggest spectacles to date.\n",
      "Eternals isn't a complete success, with issues large and small. That said...it's an impressive effort. This is a BIG swing, and while it might not be a home run, we're looking at some solid contact. For an undertaking like this, that's a win.\n",
      "Marvel Comic junkies will be thrilled with \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\".\n",
      "It's like an Assistant Editors' Month issue writ large.\n",
      "I'm tired of saying \"the special effects are great\" when nothing else in a movie is. But, yes, it's spectacularly staged.\n",
      "Great visual effects and acting by Brie Larson make for an enjoyable watch that embraces a confident and smart woman character, something rarely seen in this genre.\n",
      "Captain Marvel isn't just a feat of directing and good writing, the acting is some of the liveliest in a Marvel movie.\n",
      "Ragnarok is unpretentious high-spirited entertainment that feels like a breath of fresh air.\n",
      "When it reaches its extended climax, however, Age of Ultron perfectly delivers huge action scenes with the requisite smaller heroic beats.\n",
      "Each hero has ample time in their own spotlight (Ruffalo's Hulk shining brightest) yet Whedon constructs the enveloping sense of camaraderie seamlessly...\n",
      "It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human.\n",
      "What Whedon and Marvel have created here is not just extraordinary, but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet.\n",
      "Very entertaining, and a far tighter production than much of Marvel's recent output.\n",
      "Be prepared to sweat, cry, and clench your armrest because Avengers: Infinity War is one hell of a ride.\n",
      "The jokes are good, the music's super cheesy, but the galaxy doesn't seem in too much peril.\n",
      "It feels rich, expansive, and is clearly teeming with umpteen further stories, while it is also distinctive, authentic, and has a vitality that you can't help but become invested in.\n",
      "Vol. 2 might just be the most fun to be found in a movie theater thus far this year. It's a great sign that there's plenty of inventive life left to be found in the saturated superhero genre.\n",
      "He still catches thieves just like flies, but this Spidey makes us miss the classic web slinger.\n",
      "Weird, creative and restless, Doctor Strange is a psychedelic and fun ride that mainly satisfies by introducing a new hero to the game and expanding the MCU even more. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "James Gunn has pulled us in closer to this team of A-holes in an absolutely entertaining sequel that stands as one of Marvel's finest.\n",
      "Affirmation of Marvel's storytelling strategy of connecting films in a shared universe, but maybe more significantly, it's proof that the franchise's consistent release schedule gives the viewer better short-term recall and deeper emotional investment.\n",
      "The most shocking thing about Avengers: Endgame is that there are several moments within this colossal movie that feel like a Marvel miracle.\n",
      "Holland knocks it out of the park, striking a perfect balance between awkward, bright, and eager high schooler Peter Parker, and as newly minted, Spider-Man, still figuring out superhero-dom.\n",
      "Despite its retroactive placement in the timeline, Black Widow offers enough thrills, new characters and a spotlight on Natasha to rank near the top of standalone MCU films.\n",
      "I can't think of a movie with a higher action to non-action ratio. Or maybe I just don't want to.\n",
      "You can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first \"Avengers,\" has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 doesn't quite degenerate into a Transformers 3 ... [it's] recommended, but with major reservations.\n",
      "As weakling-turned-super-soldier Steve Rogers, Evans remains the best reason to see any movie with Captain America in it.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World strives for Star Wars with its dense world-building , but its goofy sense of humour (and overall frivolousness) makes it feel more like the first season of Buffy... This is a good kind of problem.\n",
      "Hemsworth fully embodies Thor with all the energy, passion, arrogance and blundering foolery you'd come to expect from a mythical warrior who lands on Earth.\n",
      "It's Holland's ability to capture the restless adolescent spirit that needs public affirmation, but also wants to hide under a rock, that makes it such a giddy treat. He's a recognizable kid struggling with identity issues -- on an exaggerated scale.\n",
      "The best entry of the trilogy. Downey Jr. is once again sensational. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "An impressive achievement, though not an especially interesting one.\n",
      "Razzle dazzle - with a ton of heart and a generous sprinkling of warm humor. That's \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" right there.\n",
      "Full of nobility and purpose without sacrificing fun and charm.... A slam-bang action adventure that also fills a need.\n",
      "There are some decent laughs before things turn serious, and the deft timing that has always been one of the sneakier pleasures of this multi-chapter behemoth is in evidence as heroes collide in attitude and physique.\n",
      "Such a visual grabber, with so much unexpected food for thought, that it's hard to see how it could be topped.\n",
      "The trickiest of the Avengers line-up to translate to the screen, 'Thor' deserves a lot of praise for getting right something that could have gone wrong so easily.\n",
      "Marvel's finest heroes finally come together to set a comic book franchise gold standard that will take some beating.\n",
      "'Ant-Man and the Wasp' offer laughs, adventure, and a stinger at the end.\n",
      "A colorful, outrageous, gloriously self-aware oddball adventure that isn't afraid to break the mold and poke fun at its predecessors\n",
      "It's a little overstuffed and a little overlong. One thing it's not, even a little, is disappointing.\n",
      "With its playful use of scale, Ant-Man drops a dollop of Lewis Carroll whimsy on the usual clashes of good and evil.\n",
      "There's a lot going on in Infinity War, including actual suffering, sacrifice and real emotions, most of which won't sink in until the end credits roll.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy is solid summer fun - not the mammoth epic we have come to expect from each new Marvel release, but a welcome entry into a moribund movie season.\n",
      "A perfectly fine Marvel installment that I can't fathom deeply loving or hating, although I'm sure many viewers will manage to do both.\n",
      "It works as a great culmination of the character's story over his five appearances, but functions well enough as a standalone action sci-fi comedy in its own right.\n",
      "The script is loaded with hilarious repartee and the martial arts fight scenes are choreographed like a breathtaking ballet.\n",
      "Fun and fresh, Guardians Of The Galaxy is another winner from Marvel, and further proof of a very old dictum: you've got to gamble big to win big.\n",
      "I can say nothing kinder about Thor: Ragnarok than that it is not \"one for the fans\". It's for anybody at home to the throb of a sub-woofer and the scent of the herb.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World begins as high fantasy and ends as a blown-up episode of Doctor Who.\n",
      "The future of Marvel is cosmic perfection. Even at its most spacey, the film never forgets its very human soul.\n",
      "Larson and Jackson also share easy-going chemistry that sets the general tone of the film quite early on.\n",
      "But despite its good points, not everything is honey over flakes because despite having good visual effects, the assembly feels a little lost in certain parts. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "With Doctor Strange, Marvel pries open a doorway to a new realm, one filled with magic and mysticism, dark dimensions and malevolent deities.\n",
      "See it with your kids. See it with your friends. See it with your parents. There are few surer bets at the multiplex.\n",
      "James Gunn achieves a film that perfectly combines emotional moments with humor of all kinds. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The movie is ludicrously long, clocking in at three hours and one minute, but surprisingly satisfying.\n",
      "Rudd's Lang is refreshingly self-effacing and charming. Pena is flat-out hilarious.\n",
      "A little slow getting to the meat of the plot but still has that pizzazz of being in the MCU where they blend emotions, battles and very definitely humor.\n",
      "I like him when he's angry ... or is it hungry? Norton is no good-time Downey, but this Hulk smashes the 2003 film. However, I caution the filmmakers and Marvel to be fair to their characters and ...\n",
      "The entire feeling of this film kind of gives you a sneak peek at what it would feel like seeing big screen interpretations of actual African heroes and heroines from our stories and folktales.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok aims for laughs and maximum action-movie enjoyment, and soundly delivers.\n",
      "At its best moments, Thor weaves a spot of magic from the complex science of $150-million fantasy-film technology.\n",
      "This is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adap spectrum between the good and the great.\n",
      "The most impressive aspect of what's sure to be one of the biggest blockbusters in history is how intimate and personal so much of the story is and how quieter character moments aren't lost in the shuffle.\n",
      "One of the best films from Marvel, thanks to it's richness in culture and mythology, and one of the best villains to date. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Despite the wild CGI action and Jason Bourne style one-on-one combat, Black Widow feels more grounded than most other Marvel movies.\n",
      "Seeing Downey and Bridges duel is one of the film's primary delights.\n",
      "The title \"Far From Home\" may be a little on the nose, but Sony could have just easily called this Spider-Man: Father Figures.\n",
      "Branagh and co have taken one of the least relatable superheroes and turned his story ... into a hugely enjoyable, funny and visually spectacular film\n",
      "...while one of the story lines does pick up from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's Iron Man who steals the show.\n",
      "The film does offer additional insight into the character's tortured past, but the overwhelming effect is that of a baton being passed.\n",
      "Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.\n",
      "It's a stark juxtaposition, the long periods of exposition, then the story jumps back to life with beautiful set pieces and intense action... When the characters are just being the characters, instead of listening to exposition, this is a really fun movie\n",
      "Delighting with inventive setpieces and an affable lead in Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is eccentric enough to amuse, but can often feel watered-down in execution.\n",
      "There are plenty of action scenes, a few little laughs and an air of genuine adventure; it doesn't take my breath away, but I can see it has an audience\n",
      "Only now could the MCU arrive at a place where bluffs can be irrefutably called and gauntlets, real or metaphorical, can be thrown down. With audacity and thoughtfulness, \"Infinity War\" upends the comparative breeziness of all that came before it.\n",
      "Marvel's Black Panther film means so much to so many people. The film is a lightning rod of representation, in a time where black people feel so belittled and not paid attention to.\n",
      "Rourke and Rockwell make satisfying, complementary villains, while Downey Jr. delivers again. Shame this sequel feels inessential.\n",
      "MJ grew as a character and managed to represent all the things we love about the iconic Mary Jane Watson, with a new twist, made it a delight to watch as Peter and MJ started to let their relationship form.\n",
      "You are not in for a giddy, winking, high-flying summer fling. And that's OK -- there's something appealing about such an old-fashioned approach.\n",
      "One of the sweetest - not cutesy - entries in the franchise, not to mention cheer-inducing and strong.\n",
      "It's more than happy to deliver a fun-filled movie evening, one that's both light-hearted and light-weight.\n",
      "This is a superhero movie for the ages, and especially for this age.\n",
      "Captain Marvel doesn't try to say much but merely entertain us, and it reminds us that a woman is as strong as a man, but can definitely be funnier. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "More than any other Marvel movie in their ten-year history, this film carries a legitimate edge of peril most don't have.\n",
      "Captain America: The Winter Soldier...is engrossing due to the way most of its characters work, the physicality of the big set pieces and the fact that the movie is a game-changer in the storytelling of the Marvel universe.\n",
      "Black Widow is a solid enough movie on its own, but it would've worked even better if it had come when the character still had more to offer.\n",
      "A spry, lovable Spider-Man movie about a spry, lovable Spider-Man.\n",
      "Whedon delivers a thoroughly entertaining compilation of the best of these heroes while never hiding either his giddy love for the characters or the wry wit that has formed the bedrock of his career.\n",
      "Where other comic-book fare has felt like action blockbusters with sprinkles of comic relief, Gunn has been allowed to make a comedy that happens to feature comic-book characters.\n",
      "The Avengers is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. It's smart, fast, unrelenting fun. An instant, nuanced classic.\n",
      "It's a mostly-thrilling roller coaster ride for Marvel fans, though I wouldn't say it's my favorite in the MCU canon. Some parts are overlong and some went by way too fast.\n",
      "It is his transition from a super-powered being to a full-blown superhero... a movie that doesn't really feel like any of the other Marvel movies, that has its own voice, and that pulls off its various goals with real charm.\n",
      "A Shakespearean flavoured tragedy to its backstory, with palace intrigue and hidden secrets. Where Serkis's maniacally-laughing Klaue is a bad guy who wears thin, Killmonger is one of the few movie villains I've ever felt sorry for.\n",
      "That skyward in-the-moment shot is the only one that really involved me in the film as an experience and not just a sequence of moving images.\n",
      "Thanks to its unpredictable story and avoidance of bombastic supervillain showdowns, Civil War stands out from Marvel's fun but formulaic back-catalog.\n",
      "Branagh makes the most of CGI's potential to create glimmering surfaces and vast landscapes and, for once, the 3D is a bonus.\n",
      "The tepid Vol. 2 survives mostly on our affection for the characters we met in the first film, but without that intro, it's a middling slog with precious little of the freshness or audacity that made the original such a standout.\n",
      "The finale is something else - a symphony of comedy and action mayhem that outclasses every single second that comes before it. Nothing else in the movie even comes close.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is funny, exciting and touching.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming does the improbable, successfully rebooting a reboot of a trilogy that did the job well enough only a decade ago. It's a movie that could be unnecessary but isn't.\n",
      "Endgame works very, very well as a movie, as a theme park ride, and as an experience. It is a monumental achievement. I highly doubt we will see anything like it ever again.\n",
      "Ultimately, Vol. 2 can't quite live up to the legacy of the first film, but it's got everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some.\n",
      "You root for Spider-Man / Peter Parker throughout the film, and you also get a great villain to boot, which is normally the MCU's biggest problem. I can't recommend it enough!\n",
      "An engaging goof that resists bludgeoning you with bigness and instead settles for good vibes and jokes. Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! [Squints.] It's a surprisingly enjoyable summer romp!\n",
      "This isn't Deadpool, but close. It is the perfect popcorn movie that's full of entertainment and great special effects...\n",
      "Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy.\n",
      "A beautiful, hallucinatory sequence, as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers, is the most dramatically fraught and heart-wrenching moment in any Marvel movie.\n",
      "[The Russos] have succeeded. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "The best MCU superhero origin story since Iron Man. Enough ties to the greater franchise, while still allowing Shang-Chi to shine! Seriously epic large scale fight scenes too!\n",
      "Like previous expository Marvel films much of Doctor Strange is devoted to Cumberbatch acquainting himself with his new powers. But the film's visual mindbending is what sets it apart from the studio's past releases.\n",
      "In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just what it promised to be. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "There are too many new characters, too many crossing story lines, not enough romance and our hero's a smug jerk for the first half hour. Who cares? Iron Man 2 still rocks.\n",
      "Great fun! Doctor Strange has everything you'd want or expect from a Marvel adventure, but it also feels fresh and new.\n",
      "The team needs a little bit of work, but the general character development, action, and gorgeous visuals make up for that. And obviously, so does Baby Groot.\n",
      "It's a refreshingly weird and a fun addition to the MCU.\n",
      "While the spectre of loss hangs over this sequel, there's boundless fun and pitch-perfect humour to be found within this enjoyable and entertaining rollercoaster.\n",
      "The twist in the story turns out to be more convoluted than it needs to be, but when returning director Jon Watts keeps the focus on Peter and his classmates, Spider-Man Far from Home proves to be a good time in the MCU.\n",
      "A sentimental mixture of thwarted romance, military conniving and brute-on-brute action at the end, as Hulk takes on spike-spined Abomination. If the movie's nowhere near as ambitious as the last Hulk, that's probably to the good.\n",
      "Black Widow is a dramatic spy thriller that does its character justice. The downside is that this justice was far too late.\n",
      "For the second straight year, Marvel's late-summer entry is an inventive, very enjoyable action film.\n",
      "After Iron Man's extended Avengers advert and The Incredible Hulk's misfire, it's certainly a sight for Thor eyes.\n",
      "For better and for worse, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is average. And yet, to my great indignation, it still managed to move me to laughter and a few tears.\n",
      "If there's something that we need to mention above civil war's perfect technical execution and rollercoster rythym, it's the way the characters connect with the audience after many years of exploring them. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Much like a classic mix tape, \"Vol. 2\" of [the series] is a movie that's similar in theme to its predecessor but feels fresh and original.\n",
      "While a solid film, Captain Marvel seems more intent on setting Carol Danvers up for future appearances than making her first film truly great.\n",
      "Civil War isn't great despite being the third Captain America and thirteenth overall Marvel movie - it's great because of those things.\n",
      "Downey charms the heck out of the opportunity he's given.\n",
      "Infinity War didn't wear me down in the way that Age of Ultron did, it didn't give me the high of the first Avengers either. Like I said, manage expectations and you'll be just fine.\n",
      "Director Destin Daniel Cretton breaks with traditional Marvel storytelling and uses flashbacks to propel the narrative forward. The approach emotionally charges an otherwise standard superhero origin story.\n",
      "It's not a tremendously rewarding piece of storytelling... But it's dang cool.\n",
      "Taika Waititi is rad, and this completely fun movie is evidence of that. The Hela stuff could be better, but Sakar is on-point & Jeff Goldblum is the Jeff Goldblummiest.\n",
      "Such heady motivations, coupled with heroism, is a lovely core away from the usual costumed good vs. evil throwdowns, but it's very, very profuse, complete with all of the intergalactic gibberish in between.\n",
      "Actually feels like a classic comic book: fast, furious and flip. Forget about superheroes with love problems and tortured souls.\n",
      "As stolidly drab as Thor can be, his trickster half-brother Loki is still a scream, and the picture perks up considerably when he's around, though how much more energy can be squeezed out of his antics is debatable.\n",
      "The fact is that in Infinity War... everyone has their moment and meshes perfectly with the whole. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Not a bad followup to the original Iron Man. Good performances and plenty of first-rate action. Iron Man 2 is great fun. Paul Chambers, CNN.\n",
      "Funny, engaging and entertaining, Marvel's latest superhero movie is by far their most kid-friendly. While there is scary action galore, it comes in managable comprehensible bites and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man is a genial character.\n",
      "It all adds up to a film that is just so much brilliant funtimes.\n",
      "It is a monument to everything Marvel Studios has accomplished to this point whilst also eschewing many of the expectations and clichés it helped build about the genre.\n",
      "Endgame certainly showed there was one and it was just what we needed.\n",
      "Behold! \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is the type of movie where every second sentence starts with \"behold!\"\n",
      "With plenty of surprises and the right mix between comedy and drama, Avengers: Endgame lives up to its hype\n",
      "Cate Blanchett's Hela is hella mean, hella snarky and hella striking with her hair slicked back into antlers.\n",
      "The smash-happy action is complemented by wondrous visuals and techno-chic production values. The climactic London-set battle royale, with Thor's magic mallet ever primed for slinging, holds the viewer in a vice-like grip.\n",
      "Spider-Man Homecoming is not the best movie in Marvel's highly profitable cinematic universe, but it's the best Spider-Man film ever produced.\n",
      "Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular...\n",
      "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has equal amounts of action, heart, and humor. The result is as satisfying an outing as Marvel has had in some time.\n",
      "This all makes for a gleefully entertaining, down to earth, two hours.\n",
      "Like its 2015 predecessor (which also followed on the heels of a gargantuan \"Avengers\" movie), this is a funnier, gentler, and, appropriately enough, smaller Marvel movie.\n",
      "A fantastic full stop to a 22 film series, giving us some closure to an era of cinema, but still leaving a well-lived-in Earth for new adventures to be created going forward.\n",
      "It falls short of its predecessor and is therefore a disappointment but what it lacks in grit and darkness it makes up for in fun.\n",
      "A family torn apart, war, betrayal...these are all things the Bard wrote about and who better then the classically trained Branagh to help bring the story to the screen.\n",
      "As with all of Marvel Studios' movies, the action, humour and innate silliness is tempered with something a little more thoughtful and meditative, making for a highly entertaining mix.\n",
      "None of it, however, would work without Evans' easy charm. His appeal is different to his Marvel stable mates; he is modest, kind and, ahem, a virgin (this is certainly not the persona Evans has given off in other films).\n",
      "With all of the noise, the explosions and the distractions, this ends up being a film about Thanos. And that's a good thing.\n",
      "A giddily enjoyable, convention-bucking 134-minute epic that somehow manages to simultaneously be a comic-book blockbuster, a pulsating espionage thriller and an Afro-futurist family saga.\n",
      "With its constant humor and the energetic chemistry between Rudd and Lilly, \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is the most playful of the Marvel movies\n",
      "Virtually a special-effects miracle.\n",
      "A marginal improvement over its lackluster predecessor...\n",
      "I always thought this was the dumbest idea ever, and I was wrong.\n",
      "You would think it'd be tough to live up to the super fun trailer with the rousing Led Zepellin's Immigrant Song, but the movie manages to do just that... and then some!\n",
      "Captain America: The First Avenger is pretty good, insofar as it's not nearly as terrible as it seemed destined to be.\n",
      "Roll on Thor 3.\n",
      "Captain America earns a thumbs up because of... well, because of Captain America.\n",
      "To these faintly moistened eyes, \"Avengers: Endgame\" achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis.\n",
      "By its very construction Guardians of the Galaxy is trying to both be smug and self-aware, but also heroic and adventurous. For the most part the film manages to pull off this balance, making for a fun and many ways laudable film.\n",
      "Doctor Strange holds up pretty well as an origins film.\n",
      "Almost as enjoyable as the first. Not quite the same impact, but a good ride from start to finish.\n",
      "A work of pure pop bubblegum pleasure--a rousing, thrilling, and thoroughly satisfying summer blockbuster that puts most of its multiplex-mates to shame.\n",
      "It was only two years ago in Avengers: Age of Ultron that we started to see what a gifted comic actor Hemsworth is, so it makes eminently good sense for this entire movie to be played as a comedy.\n",
      "As superhero flicks go, the first half of Captain America -- the one that counts -- is well above average. But the real superheroics here belong to the F/X team.\n",
      "The actors have settled into their characters and also grown in their performance chops, and the writers have found a more than serviceable balance between the humor of Homecoming and the gravitas of Avengers.\n",
      "Amazing? Yes. Spectacular? Most certainly. Superior? Without a shadow of a doubt.\n",
      "This satisfying adventure is rich with the things Marvel comics always did best: critiquing the consequences of power in explosive, four-color form.\n",
      "In a world where superhero movies can have the human weight of Logan (2017), you can hardly forgive Galaxy Guardians Vol. 2 for being \"entertaining and nothing more.\" But while the movie lasts, the fun is worth it. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Some rough edges, but we should cherish a glossy blockbuster that has something to say.\n",
      "Stuck on rewind in space.\n",
      "In the end, the plot of the film was still the same familiar Marvel clichés, just shown from a new perspective.\n",
      "Eternals is deeply emotional and alters the Marvel formula we know, which some will love and some will hate.\n",
      "A good movie with a breathtaking third act for any comic book fan.\n",
      "Dr Strange isn't just any old superhero, he's not gaudy and violent, he's smarter, he's gentler. He's basically a much nicer Sherlock... in a cape.\n",
      "I have to admit that it is rare to feel any kind of genuine emotion in a superhero film, but Black Panther achieves that very thing.\n",
      "Much as he did with Creed, Coogler has once again transcended the form and made a whole other kind of great movie.\n",
      "Even as Vol. 2 proves to be overlong and needlessly complex, with a last act that doesn't merely drive the point home so much as hold you hostage to it, the movie proves endearing.\n",
      "One of the best, most important superhero movies of all time.\n",
      "This latest entry in the unstoppable Marvel Studios takeover of the world is probably the most amusing film the company has made since the Kevin Feige reign began a decade ago.\n",
      "Who would have thought all it took for this critic to unabashedly like an MCU movie again was a big heart and Paul Rudd's hairy chest? This Marvel hater liked it, so give it a go.\n",
      "Ant-Man's best quality is that it doesn't try to be a superhero movie yet it endulges all the craziness in them. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Is it cliché to say this is the perfect chaser to Infinity War's fantasy opera? Well, so be it. It is.\n",
      "The epic action brought nerd tears to my eyes! Shane Black delivers a witty, action-packed flick with great twists. See it in 2D as the 3D conversion lacks great depth!\n",
      "What saves it is Favreau's work with the cast.\n",
      "Brace the box office as 'The Incredible Hulk' smashes its way through a rock 'em, sock 'em romp sure to please summer audiences\n",
      "Far From Home is a worthy addition to the Spider-Man canon, niftily balancing the geeky humour and freaky action sequences that showcases the franchise at its best.\n",
      "Marvel has done it again... It's delightfully unexpected in its willingness to scale down, yet in doing so shows us how remarkable and important the smaller things in life truly are, after all.\n",
      "I just felt this one faltered a bit toward its end. Even so, it's worth seeing for the parts that do work. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)\n",
      "A goofy movie that feels relatively fresh, and freshness is a valuable commodity in a franchise that's now nine years and 17 movies deep.\n",
      "You're gonna want to watch the next one the second this one ends. The final minutes proves just how good Marvel has been at building this universe over the past decade. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Ultimately the inspired casting, snappy humour and whizz-bang technology are the equivalent of giving your old car a new coat of paint. Iron Man is entertaining, but it still runs on the same old superhero formula.\n",
      "The Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked.\n",
      "A scrappy simulation of American idealism personified by the willingness, nay, the need, to be the first to volunteer whenever the mission requires a sacrifice for the greater good.\n",
      "Just like soap operas, there's always the chance of brain transplants, or whatever the equivalent of that is in comic books. Also remember to bring tissues.\n",
      "Powered by Rudd's goofy, good-guy sentimentality, Ant-Man filled me with something that's become a rather rare commodity in superhero movies: joy.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Far From Home perfectly addresses Avengers: Endgame, and shows us why Mysterio is a villain to be feared. Filled with action, humor, and deceit - it is a MUST SEE!\n",
      "Director Peyton Reed has a lot of fun with the concept, though epic battles on tiny scales can be a bit less breathtaking.\n",
      "Director Destin Cretton and cinematographer Bill Pope have created such a rich visual language for this film that it is unlike anything we've previously experienced in the MCU.\n",
      "Holland probably has five more years in which to dazzle us, and it'll be a crime if Batalon and Zendaya aren't by his side. This franchise is now all about Peter and his friends. Here's looking at you, kids.\n",
      "Poking fun at itself while still treating it's subject matter with respect is no easy task, but the stars handle it magnificently. \"Ant-Man\" is one of the most unexpectedly fun rides you can have in the MCU...or anywhere else for that matter.\n",
      "Director Jon Favreau builds a sturdy foundation for a franchise, an origins story that isn't as familiar as Batman's or Spider-Man's and unburdened by the angst of murdered relatives and messianic guilt.\n",
      "It's the rare superhero movie that is more fun when it's not being superheroic.\n",
      "When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "[Ant-Man] gets by on his propensity for knockabout humour, his child-like enthusiasms and the company he keeps. He's likeable, his films are kid-friendly, and that's about it.\n",
      "Delivers pretty much everything you could want from a Thor movie, thanks to a superb script, note-perfect direction from Kenneth Branagh, a terrific supporting cast and a charismatic, star-making central performance from Chris Hemsworth.\n",
      "...wears its spirituality on its sleeve (or its levitating cloak)...\n",
      "More entertaining, more inventive and more cosmic than its predecessor. It already belongs to the ranking Marvel's best. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "In Black Panther, Coogler and company have made a superhero picture that's twice as good, twice as smart, twice as fun to look at as any before it. May they get twice the credit and twice the box office.\n",
      "Adjectives used in some of Marvel Comics' iconic titles from the early 1960s through today -- amazing, fantastic, incredible -- also describe director Joss Whedon's superhero epic The Avengers.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 suffers from typical sequelitis. It bites off more than it can chew and feels drowsy as a result.\n",
      "Director Louis Leterrier, who directed The Transporter films, is no great stylist, but he adds highly charged and acrobatically choreographed action scenes to the film's blunt-force sense of melodrama and erratic continuity.\n",
      "'Doctor Strange' is a lot of fun, but it's also unquestionably the most eyeball-popping comic book movie to come along, even being worthy of paying for the 3D upgrade.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming is a soaring superhero adventure and is easily the best Spider-Man movie of them all.\n",
      "It is during those scenes with Spider-Man that Marvel Studios demonstrates its greatest strength: a certainty of tone.\n",
      "Boasts fantastic martial arts and action sequences, an all-time villain performance, and represents the integration of the MCU with an indie filmmaker that's a strong fit.\n",
      "While Black Widow makes for a great stand-alone spy thriller that packs in plenty of entertainment value, fans who have been waiting for a film that explores the character in great depth will simply have to keep waiting.\n",
      "There's an overwhelming nature to the Marvel factory's narrative, but it manages to combine these characters and genres without losing a sense of adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "That director Joss Whedon has put them all in the same movie and made it work at all is no mean feat.\n",
      "A perfectly well paced and coherent tale about revenge and the question of absolute power resulting in absolute corruption.\n",
      "It may not be as significant to the Marvel canon as, say, Black Panther but the skittish wit and playfulness wins us over.\n",
      "Endgame is truly a masterful piece of storytelling, which both goes exactly where you expect it to, and not at all.\n",
      "Okay as a diversion but nowhere close to matching any number of other singular superhero movies. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)\n",
      "A completely satisfying conclusion...with a deep understanding of the characters and a truly remarkable ability to find a nuanced balance between canon and innovation.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame is the most 'superhero movie' superhero movie ever made.\n",
      "An obvious improvement over Ang Lee's egregiously cerebral Hulk...\n",
      "There's a lot to enjoy about Marvel's latest... And yet, while Black Widow is a valiant attempt to do right by the ex-spy and Avenger, it's ultimately too little, too late.\n",
      "After 2.5 hours of watching superheroes battle dark forces, I'm exhausted. And elated.\n",
      "Takes it seriously enough to satisfy the fanboys and slyly but respectfully tantalizes them with touches only they will understand.\n",
      "It's fun, it's exciting, it's hilarious --- and then there's Chris Hemsworth.\n",
      "It's stupid-smart bits... that make up for the more routine aspects of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n",
      "Rudd remains the heart and soul by stepping back and letting everyone else fill the room. He's one of the great modern straight men, but when he lets rip... it's a quick-witted back-and-forth that's easily as funny as a drumming ant.\n",
      "The performances are so well-pitched in The Avengers, meshing with such vividness and ease, that it's tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them.\n",
      "Marvel ups the ant-e with easily one of the funniest superhero movies yet.\n",
      "Ends a phase and kicks off a new one with a few surprises, some inspired choices and a couple of clichés. - [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Gunn and company just go for whatever feels good from moment to moment. They've got jetpacks, and they're not afraid to use them. And I'll have to say, it's pretty refreshing.\n",
      "See the 2D version if you can and enjoy a commercial film that is certainly good -- but some way short of great.\n",
      "Lower your expectations and enjoy the CGI ride with characters who can do no cinematic wrong.\n",
      "It just might - might! - be the greatest Marvel movie.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp never forgets that it's a part of one of the comedic pillars of the MCU, and it keeps the jokes flying fast and free.\n",
      "It gives us what we expect: many jokes, space action sequences and a very dynamic plot. This is a hilarious film, but it's much more than just that. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Volume 2 can claim to be bigger and better than its predecessor, although it still suffers from some of the narrative sleight-of-hand issues that kept Guardians of Galaxy from achieving greatness.\n",
      "A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame didn't seem a moment too long, and there wasn't an awkward performance among its cast.\n",
      "Marvel has its first existential crisis, coming to terms with not only what it means to be a hero but also what it means to be a God. It's extremely ambitious, and while it doesn't completely soar, it still opens a whole new realm of possibilities.\n",
      "Suffers from being too long, but we love these characters too much to complain. Michael Rooker steals the movie in every scene he's in.\n",
      "It's worth seeing on a big screen, not just once but twice.\n",
      "This film introduces us to a new, younger, more upbeat, lively Spider-Man and some good new characters, including a more complex, believable villain than one usually sees in these kinds of films.\n",
      "Iron Man is funny without being silly, yet can kick ass to the moon and back when the chips are down.\n",
      "Epic and fun. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Hemsworth and Hiddleston are fun to watch, but it's not one of Marvel's best.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is a buzz-worthy blockbuster.\n",
      "Stunning action sequences, especially the climactic battle that rivals the immense Battle of Helms Deep in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.\n",
      "Heroes fighting each other over a misunderstanding or ideological conflict is a longtime comic book staple. Batman v Superman is a great example of the exact wrong way to present this sort of conflict. \"Civil War\" nails it.\n",
      "It's more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation. It's also a rollicking good blockbuster, even if it doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.\n",
      "If you channel your goofy 8th-grade self, you will love this film.\n",
      "A great film that will definitely entertain you and keep a smile on your face.\n",
      "Anchored by Whedon's trademark wit without becoming a tiresome zinger-fest, it's a thrilling and affable slice of impeccably crafted chaos.\n",
      "The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again. Plus, it's mercifully short on life lessons from Aunt May.\n",
      "Gunn... has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe.\n",
      "Paul Rudd gets plenty of big (and small) laughs in Ant-Man And The Wasp, a Marvel outing thankfully on the light side, with a breakthru female character co-headlining a Marvel film for the first time.\n",
      "Overall, it's a lot of fun before it gets somewhat bogged down. But it does redeem itself with a great surprise ending and it's one of the better comic book movies to come along in a while.\n",
      "Its cast, principally Robert Downey Jr, and some solid direction from Jon Favreau breathe a lot of life and energy into an otherwise run-of-the-mill comic book origin movie.\n",
      "Eternals isn't bad at all and ranks among the better entries of the MCU.\n",
      "A fun, layered and action-packed effort.\n",
      "Black Panther feels like the right movie we need... right now.\n",
      "Captain Marvel mixes fun and urgency with an engaging title character. It's absolutely worth seeing.\n",
      "However, it achieves a flavor of its own; it feels like its own unique superheroic proposition, and that's impressive in its own right. Frankly, I'd take this spiffy red cape over Clark Kent's any day of the week.\n",
      "It's a solid blockbuster with a few faults that you just don't mind overlooking.\n",
      "[Larson] quickly comes into her own in a role that, despite the limitations of the franchise, never quite conforms to superhero conventions.\n",
      "On par with its predecessor, Joss Whedon proves that he's more then capable of handling this franchise's biggest film, even if he's far from perfect at it.\n",
      "Just the right balance between consistency and distinctiveness, between action and wit, and, perhaps the most difficult hurdle, between magic and superpowers.\n",
      "CA:CV moves along at a brisk pace, the effects are fantastic and the superhero line-up is the best we have seen since Avengers Assemble. Bottom line, CA:CV is an entertaining film with some great action sequences.\n",
      "After years of buildup, it's a reward to patient audiences who've been waiting for this team-up for years.\n",
      "An ode to embracing the glorious ridiculousness of caped crusaders... a hammer throwing, fist-smashing good time.\n",
      "Showmanship is the order of the day for superhero sequel Iron Man 2, though the flash and dazzle distract from plot machinery that's more than a little clunky.\n",
      "Eternals offers a bold yet epic vision that further reinforces a new creative direction in the franchise.\n",
      "An adventure that you'll want to go on over and over...\n",
      "Waititi has made the third movie of the famed god of thunder the funniest in the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Will it catch lightning in a bottle and become the next great superhero franchise? By Odin's beard, I think so! (Parental Content Review also available)\n",
      "Spectacular next chapter after Endgame! Packed full of fun surprises plus a great turn by Jake Gyllenhaal, and Sony brings some edge & artistic boldness to the Marvel mix.\n",
      "These characters are Marvel's most tangibly human screen creations to date.\n",
      "Iron Man tries too hard and Captain America is far too earnest to be cool but Black Panther, both Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of the character and the film that surrounds him, is just effortlessly cool.\n",
      "Seeing the massive Drax coddle and protect Baby Groot is typical of their love for one another, and that translates into a \"family\" we can all admire.\n",
      "It's tremendous fun, even when it could be a little better.\n",
      "Even with a plot that builds off the emotional heft of Endgame, another mediocre villain, heavy dose of Disney Channel-level romance and too much clunky shtick... made this feel qualitatively more like a middle-weight contender.\n",
      "Full of exciting action and earnest emotion, Captain America: The First Avenger is perhaps the most superhero-ey of this summer's superhero movies.\n",
      "Whedon gets the vibe and the delights of Marvel comic books in the same way that Spielberg and Lucas intuitively understood the appeal of serials in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n",
      "a chockablock actioner that manages to deliver what's asked while still somehow falling short of expectations.\n",
      "\"...for me to consider  Captain America: Civil War a good movie - good enough to make me forget Prince had just died - it must be pretty good indeed.\n",
      "Holland is the perfect Peter Parker.\n",
      "Considering that it's the sixth Spider-Man movie in 15 years, and that it features the third actor in the title role, it's amazing that it's as distinctive and enjoyable as it is. You might even say that it's a marvel.\n",
      "A film that shows great muscle through a fresh perspective but remains loyal to the elements that have made past films a hit.\n",
      "In its best moments, the movie is irresistible escapism of the highest order, a scrappy, wisecracking cousin to Star Wars circa 1977. However, Vol. 2 can cruise on autopilot for a touch too long at times.\n",
      "Bigger, louder and dumber than its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is still a lot of fun.\n",
      "Not only the best-looking Marvel film but one of the most mind-bending and striking visual experiences in cinema, Doctor Strange is easy to recommend, even if it does lack some of the charm and depth of its MCU siblings.\n",
      "The point is, there's much more right than wrong in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, and enough of the original's jokey spirit to keep you primed for the third mix.\n",
      "Whedon, a pop-genre magician best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd.\n",
      "Black Widow feels like a different sort of Marvel movie. But still, with explosions.\n",
      "As an action movie, Captain Marvel is really clever, with more than a few twists that'll surprise both comics fans and newcomers...the biggest problem then, is that Captain Marvel is doing so much, we don't actually get to know her all that well.\n",
      "One my favorite Marvel movies for sure.\n",
      "Not only is it the best comedy from Marvel thus far, but... the most visually attractive film of all those that have been made. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Infinity War is going to please most people. It has some very shocking elements and a few disappointing elements...but this is a blast of a Marvel movie.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 is the sequel everyone thinks Spider-Man 2 was.\n",
      "... The movie isn't so much a work of storytelling as it is a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts -- punches peppered with punchlines.\n",
      "He's slyly funny and charmingly despicable in the early stretches of the film, which seem to good-naturedly spoof Downey's wild-child image. He also manages to make Stark's (literal) change of heart thoroughly convincing.\n",
      "This summer's superhero films may have fallen a bit flat but this one is magic.\n",
      "Despite under-imagined action sequences, the movie's intentional humor and Tom Hiddleston's well-played Loki save it from mediocrity.\n",
      "The first studio produced, major motion picture to feature a Black superhero Black Panther is a very good movie, exceptional beyond its big-budget entertainment values...\n",
      "Star Simu Liu effortlessly inhabits the role of Shang-Chi, deftly balancing the contemplative, introspective side of the character without coming off as overly dour.\n",
      "Black Panther is visually stunning, drawing artistic inspiration from every part of the African continent. But perhaps what is most impressive about the film is the villain and the political dilemma catalysed by his claim to the throne.\n",
      "...it has everything you want in a movie: thrills, chills, humor, heartbreak, romance, betrayal and really cool action sequences\n",
      "Time will tell if it pays off and if the various parts easily connect. Not every entry in the earlier series was a success. For those who enjoyed the ride, Eternals is a good start to the adventure ahead.\n",
      "This film doesn't follow the usual MCU structure, and I, for one, am happy to have something that feels fresh in a movie franchise that's been going on for more than 10 years.\n",
      "Black Widow ticks all the boxes as an enjoyable standalone MCU outing ... but it misses the target as a fitting final farewell to the title character.\n",
      "A fun, lighthearted confection that knows exactly what it wants to be and how to execute that mission.\n",
      "As I type through the tears, I can wholeheartedly report that the Marvel Cinematic Universe does not disappoint and providing fans with an endgame not soon to be forgotten. Kudos Russo Brothers and Marvel. Y'all did the damn thing!!!\n",
      "This is a film that asks on a grand scale questions we grapple with every day. How do we navigate and understand difference? Why do we value humanity so much when humans often do not seem to value each other?\n",
      "Endgame is not flawless... But goddamn if it still isn't great.\n",
      "The movie embodies what we want in a Marvel film - it's smart, cool, full of vivid stunts and effects with well-delineated characters played by top actors.\n",
      "This is a knockout sci-fi movie that travels around the universe and back, and not only does it capture the vastness of that but it's also perhaps the most beautiful, colorful film Marvel has released to date.\n",
      "A shiny, caged beast of a film that delivers on its every promise.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming is smart and sincere and dorky and fun in all the right ways.\n",
      "Doctor Strange tells a standard tale with just enough cleverness to keep the viewer interested.\n",
      "Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's \"Mister Blue Sky\" can't be all bad, but the \"Guardians\" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out.\n",
      "This Spider-Man isn't about the big moments; it celebrates the small ones.\n",
      "Masterfully directed by Branagh, Thor delivers a Shakespearian-esque superhero flick with epic action, performances & emotions making it the strongest Marvel film to date.\n",
      "You believe in T'Challa, you believe in Wakanda, and you believe - maybe for the first time - that the MCU actually matters.\n",
      "Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean ME) lost in the Geek Weeds.\n",
      "With a stellar cast, impressively choreographed martial arts sequences and a fantastic lead performance from Simu Liu, this is a refreshing and exciting entry to the MCU.\n",
      "While Hemsworth is buff and brooding as Thor, Tom Hiddleston steals every scene as the contemptuous Loki.\n",
      "Hollywood has unearthed an unlikely weapon of mass destruction: Robert Downey Jr.\n",
      "As a follow-up to \"Endgame,\" \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" is a reassuring reminder that the Marvel films to come will retain the same element of fun and personality that made that first 10 years such a great ride.\n",
      "With a string of gratifying action sequences, and a breakneck pace leavened by a frequently witty script, The Winter Soldier stands alone as a solidly entertaining blockbuster.\n",
      "Beyond the movie's financial successes, the film established Hemsworth as a charming, charismatic, funny leading man, capable of carrying out director Taika Waititi's zany vision and, for the first time, making Thor a relevant Avenger.\n",
      "Holland makes breakthrough, and rest of cast is excellent; film not so much. Hey, ho, let's kind of go?\n",
      "Ant-Man is entertaining for what it is, but is average on the scale of all the Marvel films so far. Its action is fantastic, Ant-Man's abilities pretty cool, and the setup for future films solid enough.\n",
      "The symbiosis of good versus evil is the pillar of its existence and measures up to a deeply felt extravaganza for the superhero senses. In many aspects, this is a remarkable film and the best that the MCU has offered yet.\n",
      "As compared to the overwrought, too-many-irons-in-the-fire second installment, Iron Man 3 proves its metal, oops, mettle, once again.\n",
      "Every dazzling, thrilling moment nurtures the narrative, celebrates the characters, and cradles the entire saga carefully towards a beautiful finish.\n",
      "James Gunn actually has some things to say about family and fatherhood amongst this tail of aliens, space battles and space gods.\n",
      "The engrossing 3D visuals are superbly conceived, like Inception times 1,000, as buildings start to fold in on themselves, kaleidoscope-style.\n",
      "Refreshingly simple and loads of fun, Ant-Man maximizes on its point of difference of its smallest super-hero by coating it with lots of laughter and a likeable vibe\n",
      "Fundamentally, this is a superhero movie with something to say. In fact it's the first Marvel entry with a truly topical sting.\n",
      "Its bottom-line spectacle seldom strays from the Marvel path, but still manages to explore some invigorating new ground.\n",
      "This sequel to the very successful introduction of the Guardians of the Galaxy gives us more of the same fun - dazzling CGI, funny one-liners and a simply adorable Groot.\n",
      "It's powerful, it's draining, it's fantastically harrowing.\n",
      "A wonderful sense of culture and costumed authority, creating a vibrant solo showcase for the world of Wakanda and all the political turbulence and fierceness it contains.\n",
      "The official end of Marvel's Phase 3 offers a lot of laughs, a big heart and more than enough hope for the future.\n",
      "The movie has a bunch of winning performances from 22-year-olds still credibly playing 16, it tells a complete-ish yarn while dutifully laying track for further sequels, and it shows more visual brio than your average Marvel joint.\n",
      "Thankfully, even the weakest in the Marvel collection turns out to be fairly entertaining, proving that ultimately, the size of the hero really doesn't matter at all.\n",
      "Holland is a disarming blend of teenage impetuosity, angst, and awkwardness, and one that is still absorbing with unaffected glee the whiz-bang niftiness of his superpowers.\n",
      "For all the failings on display, the mighty Marvel machine rolls along.\n",
      "Holland is immensely appealing, young but already very much a hero. My spidey-sense tells me he's just right for the job.\n",
      "It's easy to lament how long it took to bring Black Panther to the big screen. But at least the wait was worth it.\n",
      "[The] 90's is the perfect era for Captain Marvel to land in. It was the last time women could make noise without having to immediately hear a response from a dozen men screaming about their own alleged suppression. (The Internet ruined everything.)\n",
      "Filled with plenty of laughs, great spectacle, and more cool characters than you can poke Loki's sceptre at.\n",
      "There is humor strewn throughout Doctor Strange, although it sometimes felt like (at times) it was too much.\n",
      "It checked all of the boxes for me. The fight choreography, the performances and the story were all great.\n",
      "Marvel's triumph is not that we are loyal audiences, not even loyal fans. We are slaves.\n",
      "Robert Downey Jr. is clearly having a blast playing a more sardonic Tony Stark.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World is a hugely entertaining and sharply written continuation of Marvel's Phase 2, combining heart, spectacle and a shrewd lightness of touch.\n",
      "With its first self-financed production, Marvel has produced one of the best superhero movies ever made, pure popcorn pleasure for its special effects, its story, its villain, and its hero.\n",
      "This is a movie for hardcore fans. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "With uncanny timing, Marvel takes its superheroes into a domain they've never inhabited before and is all the better for it in Black Panther.\n",
      "The most important aspect is one the film never forgets: At one point or another, we are all still that awkward kid from high school.\n",
      "Holland's wonderful performance keeps everything grounded.\n",
      "It only took the Marvel Cinematic Universe 21 movies to finally make one led by a female superhero...Marvel has perfected the manoeuvre at the first time of asking with Captain Marvel.\n",
      "In the red, white and blue hue-niverse of superhero colors, black is the new beautiful.\n",
      "While very much an origins flick, this ambitious kickoff is also, happily, a movie that wows while it makes us wonder.\n",
      "Fun summer blockbuster\n",
      "Intriguing for its meta-narrative of celebrity redemption\n",
      "Darker \"Guardians 2\" still great fun.\n",
      "Because we already know how Iron Man came to be, 'Iron Man 2' isn't quite as interesting as the first film. But it does pack a super-hero wallop of action and fun.\n",
      "Letitia Wright steals the thunder as T'Challa's younger sister and Wakanda's tech and weapons genius. I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room, just to watch them out-geeking each other.\n",
      "A kaleidoscope of weirdness and innovative visual effects successfully introduce the newest Marvel superhero in director/co-writer Scott Derrickson's brilliantly bizarre Doctor Strange.\n",
      "Black Panther is a solid MCU movie, entertaining if somewhat disposable. If you like the rest of these movies ... you'll probably like this one too.\n",
      "A-grade filmmaking, as confident as it is competent, and a shiny stone in Marvel's gauntlet.\n",
      "With some incredibly innovative action, some deeper, thought-provoking themes, and a plethora of dynamic characters, both old and new, Captain America: Civil War is among the very best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Laced with political messages, Black Panther is a film to be admired for its rich, compelling story.\n",
      "There simply isn't enough that can be said about Pugh, who is the movie's secret weapon. An absolute delight from beginning to end, she delivers all the best one-liners.\n",
      "A charming, fun and entertaining ride all along the way.\n",
      "Is it a winner? The answer's yes, but only if you consider not losing to be winning.\n",
      "We've had so many superhero movies in the last decade that it's amazing one can still feel surprising. Ant-Man does. In that sense, it's a triumph.\n",
      "Bloodier action than other comic book adventures.\n",
      "The film has a perfect balance between the possible seriousness of the subject and the natural humor of its characters. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Combined with action that shifts the usual Marvel macro battle to micro dazzle, a solid cast and a high-tech heist of a plot, Ant-Man delivers a good thing in a small package.\n",
      "\"Vol. 2\" might have been a bit more focused. Still, it's an imaginative romp that once again reflects Gunn's unique and irreverent sensibility.\n",
      "You can see [Michael B.] Jordan offhandedly weighing the line in his mind like a rock he's about to lob: it's one of many nicely judged moments of performance here from a wildly appealing ensemble cast without a weak link.\n",
      "A fine addition to the Marvel Movie Universe, \"Spider-man: Homecoming\" is one of the best in the series.\n",
      "Not only a soaring adventure story, but it combines social commentary with cartoonish comic overtones, and even adds a bit of romance.\n",
      "Convoluted, messy, and over-stuffed, The Avengers: Age of Ultron also somehow manages to be an incredibly enjoyable ride. Each of the actors bring their A-game, and each of their characters has their own moment to shine.\n",
      "Grief, anguish, revenge. All of these, when rendered onto the canvas of a well-rounded character, are so much more potent than the sight of a city crashing into another city or a looming CGI spaceship drawing ever nearer to its fatal destination.\n",
      "Doubles down on the things that made the first film a hit\n",
      "The present-day need for new myths is laid bare in Black Panther.\n",
      "Not just one of the more entertaining Marvel movies - infinitely better than Joss Whedon's overstuffed Avengers: Age of Ultron - but a genuinely fun and clever deconstruction of the genre, too.\n",
      "The Winter Soldier is consistently engaging, exciting in bursts, but there's not one point in which the film ever excels.\n",
      "That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that's good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which inches even further to the end of the limb the original Guardians film went out on in 2014.\n",
      "Afterwards, your belly will be full of superhero goodness.\n",
      "We waited two years for this. And it's so worth it. Yeah, it's good.\n",
      "Paul Rudd puts the \"A\" in Ant-Man. Affable, likeable, down to earth...There is a softer heroic element to the story and film overall which is brought to life by the authentic Jimmy Stewart \"aw shucks\" persona of Rudd.\n",
      "There is much to like about \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" There was much to love about \"The Avengers,\" and therein lies the difference.\n",
      "Given the unholy mess of Carol's continuity, the film's multi-authored script makes a fair fist of delivering fragments of backstory as recovered memory.\n",
      "Just as good as it needs to be -- and no more. But in the realm of superhero movies, I'm perfectly fine with that.\n",
      "It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an \"event\" every time it's on, you know?\n",
      "Ant Man and the Wasp is a gossamer, near-goofy mess elevated by arguably the most stacked cast in a standalone Marvel movie.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame is everything you've ever dreamed a Marvel movie could be. It's a three-hour adrenaline shot to the heart featuring mysteries solved, consequences suffered, shock, awe, and delight\n",
      "Perfectly disposable pop culture.\n",
      "Epic and spectacular, an emotional rollercoaster that none of us will ever forget.\n",
      "This movie came and did the damn thing... Everybody killed it.\n",
      "It's taken six films and three iterations of the character, but Spider-Man: Homecoming is finally the comic version Spider-Man come to the big screen.\n",
      "Even as the movie forces audiences to submit to so many cataclysmic events, the directors manage to direct the cascading mayhem to a unique kind of cliffhanger.\n",
      "The Superhero film has truly become our Western.\n",
      "It's a summer blockbuster worthy of the moniker.\n",
      "This is 'Avengers: Disassemble', a dark but deliberate film that, despite some flaws, is easily the best group flick that Marvel has yet produced.\n",
      "This one is okay, but I'm a little burnt out on the whole superhero thing.\n",
      "The players salvage this thing with their acting and awesome thighs, and the fun really kicks in when Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the squabble in an exhilarating airport sequence.\n",
      "You can appreciate and enjoy what the film tries to do, and what it accomplishes, while still wishing for something more.\n",
      "Coming out a month after the miserable bomb that was Batman V Superman has only helped to make Marvel's latest entry into the Avengers franchise look like a damn classic in comparison.\n",
      "The movie proves a solid if not superb opening salvo for the weakling-turned-super soldier.\n",
      "...delivers the goods as a summer blockbuster; as a curtain-call for Johansson, this kicks the requisite ass...\n",
      "Action-filled and funny, Guardians of the Galaxy stakes a late claim for the summer's best film.\n",
      "It's simultaneously a beautiful send-off, a greatest hits tour and a lap of honour. This is Marvel celebrating Marvel, and it is thoroughly deserved.\n",
      "High on action, great insight into Natasha's family backstory and great message on female empowerment. Florence Pugh steals the show while bieng the perfect compliment to Scarlett Johansson's Natasha. Loved it!!!!\n",
      "It won't change your life but you'll walk away smiling.\n",
      "The great interplay between the title character and his sarcastic brother Loki make this sequel worthwhile.\n",
      "[T]he film isn't so much about conflict as it is about discovery.\n",
      "This sequel doesn't have as much snappy repartée as the original that made audiences howl and want more. But the [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2] provide more than enough, in another wild ride.\n",
      "In the diminutive figure's second effort, average things come in small packages.\n",
      "Avengers: Infinity War will chew you up, spit you out, and leave you a shell of a fan in the best way possible. Another huge win for Marvel Studios, there's not a chance in hell you'll walk out of the cinema disappointed with this epic masterpiece.\n",
      "A slickly-attractive, well-cast and solidly-constructed piece of mainstream action-adventure entertainment.\n",
      "The Main Event is pretty much what you'd expect ‒ noisy, overlong, wall-to-wall CG effects and arcane superhero lore ... Yes, it's all fairly formulaic, but on a Wow! scale never before experienced.\n",
      "Captain Marvel is full of hysterical funny moments, gorgeous visuals and is an action packed spectacle. It is one of Marvel's best films, Brie Larson is perfectly cast as the relentless \"Avenger\".\n",
      "Black Panther proves that you can make a movie that is significant to the black audience, and just a damn good superhero movie that everyone can enjoy.\n",
      "a fun night at the movies but unfortunately disposable\n",
      "My goodness this is fun.\n",
      "MCU newbies Florence Pugh and David Harbour steal a surprisingly adventurous spin-off.\n",
      "Whedon delivers an uneven, if entertaining second installment that, like many superheroes, has both great strengths and hidden weaknesses.\n",
      "From Thor and Hulk sitting on a bed talking about their feelings, to Goldblum being his most Goldblum, \"Ragnarok\" is an enjoyable break from the more \"serious\" issues explored in the MCU.\n",
      "Kenneth Branagh and the team of writers who have brought the super-hero spin on the Norse god of thunder to the big screen decide to largely ditch the usual hero alter-ego bit. In its place is a movie with a split personality of its own.\n",
      "What [Ryan] Coogler and his cast have achieved with this film is so rewarding and distinctive. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Mostly ... this is a weird and witty breath of fresh air- and as a bonus it also finds a neat solution to the excessive third-act destruction of The Avengers/Captain America films without stinting on spectacle.\n",
      "Doesn't break any new ground or transcend its genre. But it's still very entertaining and never boring.\n",
      "Despite its obvious flaws, it's easy to appreciate the willingness to try something different in Eternals.\n",
      "An out of this world experience packed full of strong performances, stellar story beats, and fresh ideas help ensure that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of Marvel's best movies to date. It may, in fact, be their greatest of all-time.\n",
      "'Shang-Chi' isn't some sort of genre masterpiece. It's not even in the upper tier of Marvel movies. But it is good, old-fashioned dorky B-movie fun.\n",
      "A potent mix of testosterone and adrenalin and action fans of all ages should be happy to hand over their green.\n",
      "Shang-Chi is one of the best films in the MCU, featuring the most incredible fight scenes I have seen on film and a refreshing script exuding tremendous heart.\n",
      "this screenplay - be it out of necessity or design - might be the most inventive film in the Marvel canon, able to navigate a creative triptych through the annals of MCU lore without a bunch of forced flashbacks or awkward cameos\n",
      "Captain Marvel is by no means the next best superhero movie. But it is a lot of fun, and a solid foundation for a character with plenty of potential in the MCU.\n",
      "Once \"Black Panther\" gets out of its crouching position and goes on a sprint, it's an engaging ride that rarely lets up.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy is a pleasant surprise from start to finish, an all-rounder of a blockbuster that excels in making us laugh as potently as it awes with its sensational action packed style.\n",
      "Despite Eric Pearson's unexceptional screenplay, she [Shortland] directs with hectic energy, mixing espionage conspiracy, family drama and combat sequences with passion.\n",
      "It's fine, it's familiar, it's got Kurt Russell and a cute Groot so of course it'll make a motza.\n",
      "The Avengers' defeat of Thanos has opened up all kinds of possibilities, and this movie is eager to tinker with them in ways that surprise even the most prepared superhero.\n",
      "Far From Home is a home run. It signs off on one Marvel era, sets up the next and a sequel can't come soon enough.\n",
      "Technology has done double-edged duty to the legendary Hulk character. The CGI-created ripped body of nothing remotely reminiscent of Edward Norton blows away Lou Ferrigno's 1978 character -- as long as you don't look him in the face.\n",
      "There are some terrific action sequences. I particularly liked it when the Hulk used a car broken in two as boxing gloves.\n",
      "A tremendous feat of filmmaking. It will leave you breathless. It will make you laugh constantly. It will make you cheer. It will make you think about the positions these characters take, and it may put you at odds with a hero you love.\n",
      "While this sequel may pales in comparison to Sony's recent Spider-Man outing Into the Spider-Verse (2018), Far From Home is still a fun, energetic episode that manages to keep you entertained from start to finish.\n",
      "Marvel is getting increasingly good at delivering great movies based on material that shouldn't really work on film.\n",
      "A Marvel film giving off the repeated vibe that in some other space and time, Pixar might have made it.\n",
      "The repercussions of superhero life and the weight of family legacy take centre stage in this busy yet charismatic superhero melodrama.\n",
      "The stunts are spectacular and the suits - whether flying or fighting - are terrific, while the humans add an edginess to the always fast-paced proceedings. The adults are, as you would expect, well oiled and seamless in their roles\n",
      "The scene-stealer is Ruffalo, who provides Bruce Banner with a soulfulness missing in the portrayals by Bana and Norton. This is also the first film to nail the Hulk, who in 2003 looked like a video blip Gumby and in 2008 seemed shellacked in plastic.\n",
      "A good, disposable piece of FX-driven entertainment, even if it comes with the obligatory one-act storyline, lack of originality and 30-minute over-run.\n",
      "The film claims that the true power of Peter Parker are his naive youth and sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "It's impossible to picture anyone other than Boseman in the lead role - but by god - Michel B. Jordan certainly gives him a run for his money.\n",
      "Despite the film's white western gaze towards some of its characters, it's not only aesthetically alluring, but employs eastern philosophies like Buddhism and Taoism to build its narrative framework - a far cry from the way most Hollywood stories are told\n",
      "Director Joe Johnston re-confirms his mastery of special effects, but he doesn't let them get in the way of his telling a story.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Homecoming reintroduced an excitement to a character who lost his pizazz a decade ago, and in doing so, reminded us why we loved watching Spider-Man on the big screen in the first place.\n",
      "It works as a smash-'em-up summer film and is more satisfactory than its predecessor.\n",
      "To make such a grand statement, ya gotta break some barriers, and the film's largely black cast certainly does that, with their performances being the best part of a film loaded with great parts...\n",
      "Black Widow remains a tried and true hero, the first female superhero that wins with skills and sheer will. She's a ferocious and fierce Avenger. This Black Widow packs a wicked and awesome punch.\n",
      "With its vast cast, ever-accelerating action and cameos from the wider Marvel world, it has to keep doubling down on spectacle as it races to its epic conclusion.\n",
      "This is a big budget film directed by a black man, with a black superhero and a largely black cast. This kind of black power is something so rare in movies that it seemed like I was watching a foreign film, made in Wakanda, rather than Hollywood.\n",
      "The best thing about \"Ant-Man\" is that, for much of its running time, it doesn't seem like a Marvel Comics superhero movie. The worst thing about it is that it eventually does.\n",
      "Don Cheadle, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and again Gwyneth Paltrow are gladly on hand, but only Robert Downey Jr. can so comfortably guide us through the conspicuous outlay.\n",
      "Guardians succeeds when it proves the Marvel formula is malleable; it fails when it discovers that formula is not yet malleable enough.\n",
      "What, if anything, holds \"Ant-Man\" together? First, Paul Rudd, who is laughably unheroic, and has the grace to know as much ...\n",
      "Although it verges on fan-service and self-service, the film's central hour earns both because the balance of comedy, drama and action to playful invention and careful characterisation holds so sure.\n",
      "\"The Avengers\" is an entertaining showcase for the Marvel characters. Credit for that goes to Joss Whedon, whose script is witty and whose appreciation for these characters is evident.\n",
      "This is Marvel doing the absolute best version of the formula it's been criticised for overusing. They've blown it right up and now need to throw out that formula for good.\n",
      "Here's the surprising good news: lightning has struck twice. Everything I enjoyed about the first movie is repeated successfully. It's funny, imaginative, full of action-not violent action-and knockout visual effects that serve the story\n",
      "Gunn and his cast understand that the interplay among the quirky Guardians is what matters. The next Avengers movie already looks silly by comparison.\n",
      "The whole thing is so consistently entertaining it practically doesn't matter that not every piece makes as much logical sense as it probably should.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 is an ominously exciting, shoot-the-works comic-book spectacular.\n",
      "Since Best Picture Oscars are awarded to Producers then the Producers of Marvel's The Avengers deserve a best picture Oscar just for pulling this off. The fact that the movie is freaking amazing is just icing on the cake!\n",
      "Black Panther is a great MCU superhero adventure that smoothly blends rich narrative substance with sheer popcorn entertainment.\n",
      "Age of Ultron's first act is basically one long doozy of a set piece, which manages to give us time alone with every principle character and give them some connective tissue in battle together, too.\n",
      "Strong visuals, gonzo action and a high comedy compensate for generic plotting, a padded midsection and a lack of drama.\n",
      "[A] masterpiece of comic book cinema... part Iron Man, part The Matrix, part The Conjuring, and part Harry Potter [with] a dash of Inception, a pinch of Nightmare on Elm Street, [and] a hint of Hero...\n",
      "An entertaining chapter in the life of a maturing Parker...Considering that this is a summer that birthed the woeful \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters, that \"Far From Home\" is more entertaining than a sequel has a right to be is miracle enough.\n",
      "Endgame mostly sticks the landing with a satisfying conclusion, providing a final act to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that emotionally resonates in surprising ways.\n",
      "Thor may not be a game-changer for comic book movies, but it's a solidly entertaining one most noteworthy for taking what could have been utterly campy material and making it dramatic and relatable.\n",
      "Think heavy-metal Lord of the Rings. With wormholes. It's completely mad and kind of awesome.\n",
      "Essentially, this Incredible Hulk is a science fiction, Jekyll and Hyde version of The Bourne Identity.\n",
      "I'd say it's on par with Thor: Ragnarok for being a mostly jovial entry into the MCU and I like it just about as much. I also can't wait to see what Larson brings to the table in Avengers: End Game.\n",
      "Even moviegoers suffering from superhero burnout might want to stand up and salute Captain America, which doesn't match the excellence of X-Men: First-Class but ranks ahead of fellow summer stablemates Thor and Green Lantern.\n",
      "I hope Sony don't do another reboot for some time now; I'd enjoy following this new iteration of the franchise for a while. [Full review in Portuguese.]\n",
      "Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.\n",
      "A tad familiar, with Marvel franchise fatigue setting in, but overall it's enjoyable.\n",
      "Black Widow can best be described as The Americans meets 007 in a highly entertaining adventure. Florence Pugh steals the show with her magnetic screen presence.\n",
      "Even though the film is Marvel's crowning aesthetic triumph, even though all four of its stars have their game faces on and act their hearts out, even though it's got great humor and spirit, Doctor Strange isn't close to being Marvel's best movie.\n",
      "Effectively balancing the serious with the comic, 'Shang-Chi' is an entirely satisfying spectacle within its genre, and a very good, emotionally satisfying--and fun-super hero movie.\n",
      "Although Spider-Man: Far From Home feels like it was released a bit too soon after Avengers: Endgame, the high school-focused sequel is still funny, frothy, and fun.\n",
      "Captain America takes you back to the simplicity of a Saturday morning serial where you cheered the hero and booed the villain.\n",
      "The Winter Soldier is no labored treatise on political science; it fulfills all the expectations of a Marvel movie. But this time the danger doesn't emanate from a fantasy villain like Neutron or an imaginary realm like Asgard.\n",
      "\"Avengers: Endgame\" brings the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a worthy conclusion, eliciting more emotion than any superhero film yet. I laughed, cried, and was filled with joy.\n",
      "Coogler delivers action with frenetic grace, keeping the violence more intimate than usual for a superhero movie. Less soulless metropolis crumbling and more face-to-face combat (although the armored rhinos aren't bad).\n",
      "Infinity War works on a visual, narrative and emotional level.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame succeeds in delivering both the epic scope such a finale demands, and the personal touches that have made the whole franchise so winning.\n",
      "The CGI impresses. However, the characters supersede the special effects.\n",
      "It pays off the emotional investment movie audiences have been making in these characters for years, sometimes in genuinely heart-wrenching ways.\n",
      "The film is neither a masterpiece or a calamity; instead, it's a perfectly fun, entertaining installment in a larger narrative arc that's very clearly working to set up the MCU's evolution into its next phase.\n",
      "The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.\n",
      "Spoiler Free Review. The Avengers Assemble for one last epic, spectacular outing. Avengers: Endgame is indeed everything that hardcore fans could hope for\n",
      "Spider-Man: Far From Home is a typical movie from the Marvel Universe: a lot of jokes -- some of them work and others don't -- very attractive and entertaining, but nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Minor Marvel is still a step above other blockbusters\n",
      "Endgame often pays tribute to itself, which makes it as fascinating as it is self-serious. It taps into a live wire of doomy tragedy and phoenix-like rebirth that comics do so well.\n",
      "Will not be going down anytime soon as one of the quintessentially great superhero efforts, but it isn't a failure, either.\n",
      "The stars make it a fun ride, even when the action goes \"Roger Moore as James Bond\" goofy\n",
      "Plenty of other Easter eggs abound throughout, but the only wish I have is that this and future MCU movies remember to keep the human side as strong as the super heroics and not devolve into murky mayhem when the action hits.\n",
      "Small but mighty\n",
      "The saga is uneven and there are plot holes, but as a popcorn movie steeped in action, it keeps our attention.\n",
      "...what it lacks in wonder and awe-inducing moments it makes up for in warmth and heart and a strong sense of who Captain Marvel is and where she's going.\n",
      "Runs maybe a bit overlong - those flashbacks! - but it's rarely less than an entertaining and at times affecting entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "The Winter Soldier offers plenty for franchise fanatics to chew on, but a half-baked genre switch and increasingly daft 'political' themes make Cap's transitional adventure a minor Marvel at best.\n",
      "\"Eternals\" is a strange film, both within context and on its own. But in the lookalike, soundalike and corporately synergistic MCU, perhaps that's not such a bad thing.\n",
      "But most importantly, like its predecessor, this film is fully aware of itself and its objectives - take you on a jaunty adventure and make you laugh in the process\n",
      "The Norse gods are off to a decent, though not divine, start in Thor, the latest movie in Marvel Comics' big-screen expansion of its superhero pantheon.\n",
      "If \"Doctor Strange\" can be dispiritingly safe, it can also be just as impressively bold - an hallucinogenic trip along a very familiar path, watching the film is like adding a large dose of LSD to your morning commute.\n",
      "Ultimately, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun, energetic, and entertaining blockbuster, and far better than what's been in cinemas these last two months.\n",
      "Pure popcorn fun, engaging and eye-catching. Just as the emotional beats tend to hit the mark, the action scenes hit their mark too.\n",
      "It's overlong, overcrowded and over here. But it gives everyone a go on the tricycle and propels each to dramatic (if not exactly fresh) catastrophes.\n",
      "The performers ensure all the apocalyptic sparkle feels human. Thanks to their sense of committed purpose in making it personal, Captain America transcends patriotism and hits the universal.\n",
      "Thor: The Dark World is a movie that understands why we like these characters, how they work and how to best bounce them off each other. I'll forgive the overclocked pacing because the movie swept me so perfectly into a big, weird world.\n",
      "Taika Waititi offers Marvel majesty via Monty Python.\n",
      "Sock, pow, zowie--plenty of firepower in the summer's first big lallapalooza.\n",
      "Fans of all that has come before will weep tears of giddy joy at how crowd-pleasingly cohesive -- and ridiculously fun -- this film is.\n",
      "Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Robert Downey, Jr. is an unusually good leading man ... and has great comic timing in this movie.\n",
      "This cap to a villain arc that began in Thor (2011) features the most gloriously fluid and beautifully-paced action sequences this reviewer has seen in a superhero film, but marred by a distractingly high number of convenient plot contrivances...\n",
      "More than compensates for the story's averageness with consistently witty dialogue and a stream of terrific moments.\n",
      "A film tinted with mischievous humor and charm, turning it into a singular variant of Marvel's ingenious dramatic world. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is another great example of what comic book movies should be: a good time.\n",
      "Captain Marvel has given us an engaging female character that does not come off as an empty 'agenda'. Larson's magnetic performance paired with an entertaining buddy-cop romp and some character moments makes this another strong entry into the MCU.\n",
      "Less hammer, more humor. Ragnarok gives Thor's comic-book core a fresh, zippy new spin.\n",
      "Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel hardcore. Like 'Holy %$#@#$' hardcore. Like, 'I won't be able to eat for a year,' hardcore. Like, 'I want to go to bed and cry now.' Oh my God Marvel, what have you done? How dare you Thanos?\n",
      "The Avengers, we're told, are greater than the sum of their parts. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not. But it still boasts some pretty incredible parts. And one heck of a party.\n",
      "It gives the character the fun and carefree attitude he's needed for years, but in grounding him so much from the larger Avengers action it robs him of his sincerity.\n",
      "There is lots to love here: the way Downey balances acerbic wit and heartfelt feeling. The way Ruffalo somehow manages to invest Hulk/Banner with warmth. Evans' all-American sincerity.\n",
      "It is an entertaining action movie that features a confident lead who takes the role seriously, so you take the story about magic seriously.\n",
      "Seeing so many wonderful, powerful, amazing characters that are well written and the fact that they were able to do a movie that was Black for Marvel and that it was good exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "Centers its narrative not on superheroes, but on family, the sins of our fathers, and the flawed heroes they can be.\n",
      "The MCU has generally successfully balanced planetary and personal stakes. Endgame is a worthy culmination of that storytelling approach.\n",
      "Doctor Strange fulfills the requirements of a Marvel origin story while feeling wonderfully unencumbered by any of the franchise maintenance that handicapped Avengers: Age Of Ultron and Ant-Man.\n",
      "A good time at the movies... If the first film felt more carefully laid out, the sequel succeeds in stoking some Pixar-style emotion in its family dynamics...\n",
      "I appreciate the way that Cate Shortland adapts herself well to an action film... This is one of the individual [Marvel Cinematic Universe] films that I would keep.\n",
      "So whose side am I on? #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? Um, #TeamScarletWitch, OBVS. I was super stoked to see both her and Black Widow get as much screen time as they did.\n",
      "When \"Black Panther\" works, it's thrillingly alive.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame goes galaxies beyond expectations and exceeds anything that any of us could have imagined. The perfect end to an incredible series of films.\n",
      "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best MCU films since Black Panther.\n",
      "Among comic-book films, it's up there with Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 (the first).\n",
      "Captain Marvel succeeds not only as an introduction to a new Marvel hero but as a time at the movies that is consistently interested in what it feels like to be a girl and a woman.\n",
      "\"Avengers: Endgame\" feels more like a Christopher Nolan movie than one stemming from the MCU. It's also, by far, the best 'Avengers' movie of the four released.\n",
      "As a continuation of the risk-taking Thanos saga, the feature isn't quite as daring as expected.\n",
      "If \"Into the Spider-Verse\" explored all the different ways to be Spider-Man, \"Far from Home\" dives into the heart of what it means to be hero, a responsibility that isn't always easy. Good thing Spidey is one of the best.\n",
      "\"Captain Marvel\" is a hero that Marvel fans deserve, even if the movie that introduces her isn't everything you want it to be.\n",
      "Coogler and his team have conjured a universe and fleshed out its players, one existing (honestly, thriving) in the even bigger cinematic universe that is Marvel.\n",
      "The Winter Soldier is not just a good film. It's a great one.\n",
      "It feels like a curtain closing...there was an elegance in the way they moved toward conclusion. No fan is going to watch and feel short-changed.\n",
      "The film is engaging, entertaining, and dark enough for me to get a kick out of the reveling evil on screen.\n",
      "The movie is fun, but not as much fun as it could be because it feels like it's so busy enjoying its own cleverness it doesn't even need an audience.\n",
      "Director Joss Whedon's strengths - and better writing - really come through in the quieter moments. Relish those while you can.\n",
      "I think they've really created characters, James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Pearlman, and I think the screenplay is really lovely.\n",
      "While it ultimately gives in to the demands of the MCU,Eternalsstrives to be more than just another superhero movie. It's the reason why it has won me over, and may be the reason why it won't work for others.\n",
      "God of Thunder fights his villainous sister to defend Asgard in a splashy, joke-filled Marvel outing.\n",
      "The third time's a charmer for this Marvel franchise, thanks to a clever script and, of course, its inimitable star.\n",
      "Watching a Shane Black movie is like listening to a noisy garage band, where no matter how sloppily they skronk through a verse, when they tighten up and hit that sing-along chorus, the lack of polish somehow makes it sound even better.\n",
      "If this were truly Scarlett Johansson's last outing as Black Widow, she'd have ended on a high note. A fun mix of spy thriller + superhero genre that's essentially about family, featuring a scene stealing performance from Florence Pugh.\n",
      "Part rom-com, part \"Avengers: Endgame\" sequel, and completely action-packed, \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" will make you laugh, tear up, and cheer all the way through.\n",
      "There's nothing snarky or air quote-ish about the story, but there is a recognition that this is a superhero the size of a grain of rice. In this case, that's super enough.\n",
      "'Black Panther' is a Marvel-ous masterpiece.\n",
      "The film is well directed, edited, and paced, but it's really Downey Jr. that adds the spark, the flair, the heavy metal.\n",
      "Black Widow exceeds expectations with a fast-moving adventure that finally gives Scarlett Johansson's Avenger the solo chapter she deserves.\n",
      "Exciting and hugely entertaining, it's an eye-popping spectacle with suprisingly clever, whimsical dialogue and wisecracking one-liners.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok right from the outset establishes a comedic tone new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and recasts hunky Chris Hemsworth as comic relief.\n",
      "Not quite reaching the all-out perfection of the original, Guardians Vol. 2 is still a brilliantly cool addition to the MCU, soundtracked at every beat with nostalgic hooky lines and riffs, and mostly delivering on the promise of the first.\n",
      "This Guardians finally hits the gloriously ridiculous extremes that the first adventure never quite reached\n",
      "A mostly decent Marvel movie buoyed by crisp, kinetic action and the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best \"villain\" yet.\n",
      "Each half is solid enough that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings really could have been two separate films: An origin story and its bombastic sequel.\n",
      "The results are astonishing.\n",
      "A gooey plate of nachos that shouldn't constitute your whole diet, but is perfectly enjoyable for now, even when it congeals at the end into a wet, sloppy mess.\n",
      "Pacy and punchy, but not quite a knockout.\n",
      "Often entertaining yet exhausting.\n",
      "This mischievous film never tires of teasing the conventions and traditions of the genre.\n",
      "Taika Waititi's highly self-aware Thor: Ragnarok is a fitting response to the pomposity and pretentiousness that mark most movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Its adherence to the tried-and-true conventions of a Phase One Marvel origin story, 10 years into an increasingly complex cinematic universe, might leave you neither overjoyed nor underwhelmed, but satisfied and wondering what's for dinner.\n",
      "More convincing as sex fantasy than political allegory, Iron Man suggests the answer to combating Them is for Us to reestablish the link between mechanized killing and the body.\n",
      "The best part of the film is, without a doubt, the chemistry between Johansson and Pugh, who fight and make up with the intensity of real siblings.\n",
      "Although the sequel's script isn't as clever as its forerunner and depends too much on bumbling slapstick, \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is often laugh-out-loud hilarious, while still giving the story the requisite emotional heft and action sequences.\n",
      "Like Greek gods before them, superheroes are our modern myths, so why shouldn't they examine issues of the classic texts in our time? The end credit sequence actually gives this idea a visual corollary, as it shows a giant Hellenistic statue.\n",
      "The 14th installment in the ever-expanding MCU is the first to really exploit the possibilities of CGI -- to use state-of-the-art technology to its full, jaw-dropping advantage.\n",
      "Thrills are intermittently present when the story isn't in explanation mode, giving Johansson something to work with as her co-stars get a little hammy to make their presence known.\n",
      "Marvel movie die-hards will come away having found nuggets of pleasure, but those who complain about superhero sagas will find plenty to support their arguments here.\n",
      "Simple, blunt and very good at what it does; in that sense, it matches its amiable lunkhead of a hero.\n",
      "As Marvel Studios grows in confidence and experience, it's prepared to test its audience with greater forays into adult territory: movie's unapologetically targeted at their loyal readership.\n",
      "[it] generally moves along with moxie, charm, gobs of special effects and stunt work, and fond memories of the USO style shows that sold war bonds and boosted support in the battle against the Nazis. Yes, there's even some singing and dancing.\n",
      "A powerful, new Marvel superhero arrives in an exciting, exhilarating, socially relevant, Afro-futurist origin story..\n",
      "Winter Soldier fares best when the characters get to breathe a bit. Evans is both a solid team player and a terrific solo act, playing well off of both Mackie and Johansson and going a bit deeper when required.\n",
      "Captain America: Civil War, the third and perhaps final installment of the Captain America movie franchise is the kind of smart, emotionally resonant and visually exhilarating movie fans of the genre have been waiting for.\n",
      "...a bright, vivid, compelling cocktail...\n",
      "What's not to like about a super-hero flick that delivers in imagination, excess, humour and star power? Humour is central to the plot but the storyline never loses sight of its commendable themes: good versus evil, integrity, loyalty and courage\n",
      "The most confusing and convoluted of any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, yet it's also unbelievably satisfying.\n",
      "Just another run-of-the-mill Marvel origin story that surprises with bursts of flair and humor, as if remnants from Wright and Cornish's script managed to fight their way into the final cut.\n",
      "Like the antic entertainer at a children's party, director Taiki Waititi keeps us distracted with sudden noises, bright objects and silly jokes. It's not a bad plan.\n",
      "Branagh creates a nice flow, with many dynamic angles, and clear, exciting fight scenes.\n",
      "Doctor Strange, the 14th film in the franchise based on Marvel comic books, is one of the funniest of recent times, lifted beyond the ordinary world, as befits the story, by a superb cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role.\n",
      "Overall, this is a decent start to another franchise, and it doesn't matter whether you like it or not. Ant-Man will be back in next year's Captain America: Civil War.\n",
      "It throws everything at you ... . A good deal of it, amazingly, sticks, even if it quickly slides off like a cheap suction cup on a dirty window.\n",
      "[Captain Marvel] gives young ladies another strong role model to look up, a confident and capable woman who rails against the patriarchy and the cries of \"you don't belong here\" and emerges triumphant.\n",
      "Follows the all-too-familiar mantra of blockbuster sequels - more of everything is better-but it can't be accused of lackluster filmmaking.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 amps up what you loved about the first film, but a frustratingly unfocused plot keeps it from surpassing its predecessor.\n",
      "It's fun, highly amusing -- I'm talking laugh out loud -- and wildly entertaining.\n",
      "There is nothing ground breaking about what Marvel is doing here, but there is so much fun to be had with these people and this world that nothing was going to shrink the smile on my face.\n",
      "A timely narrative, deep exploration of fan-favorite characters, and unforgettable action set pieces make Captain America: The Winter Soldier one of Marvel's best.\n",
      "Downey seems to have found a comfort zone, and his enjoyment combined with a charismatic personality transcends the screen. Eye candy is dished out with the attractive sexiness of Paltrow and Johansson, who joust for affectionate testosterone-fueled respo\n",
      "Any other actor in a high-collared burgundy cape and goatee would risk looking like a lounge magician. But Benedict Cumberbatch is so unmannered, so smart, so playful, he makes the title character...one of the best Marvel movie superheroes yet.\n",
      "At least the movie takes awhile before it goes into full tilt action, and even when it does, it never completely loses itself or its central character.\n",
      "After the overkill of Avengers: Age of Ultron, it's nice to see Marvel return to a comparatively small-scale effort -- in more ways than one.\n",
      "Thus comes to an end, 21 films and 11 years later, the most lucrative franchise in the history of cinema... There are notable ups and downs in [this] long journey, and the conclusion is no exception. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "Whedon's investment in building this world is so complete that it captures the audience, as well.\n",
      "This is pretty much a perfect Peter Parker pic. It's certainly one of the most enjoyable solo superhero adventures I've seen in years, and at just over two hours it rattles along at a nice pace.\n",
      "I knew there was a planet of Frost Giants, but I always assumed the neighboring planet of Heat Misers would keep them in check.\n",
      "Iron Man 3 is passable mindless entertainment, but even if the film grosses $1 billion worldwide the franchise has run its course.\n",
      "The Russos, while tipping their hat to these individual filmmakers who put their unique stamp on each of their own films, elevate their own art and skilfully weave a story that seems cohesive and resonant, physically and emotionally.\n",
      "Quick on its feet, fun and funny, yet not smug and self-satisfied a la \"Deadpool.\" It's such a blast it took me a long time to realize I didn't care about anyone or anything that happened.\n",
      "Real biceps, a dirty-blond mane, and the refreshing physicality of Hemsworth's general presence beat these other pixellated champs at their own game, giving this movie and its hero a less schizoid identity.\n",
      "The scale of Eternals is unlike anything we've seen to date in the MCU, but it also ends up in a movie that just has too much on its plate.\n",
      "Black (co-writing with Drew Pearce) certainly has a knack for poking exposed cultural nerves. Limbless war veterans, terrorist videos and a mass shooting find their way into his fantasy. No wonder Iron Man has PTSD.\n",
      "Totally lacking in ambiguity, Captain America is great fun.\n",
      "It's a rollercoaster ride that leaves you breathless, invested and eventually panting for more. Marvel's Cinematic Universe really is something to savour and hold up as special.\n",
      "'Captain Marvel,' set in the mid-1990s, is not the best offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's like an old car on a freezing, winter day. It sputters when you start it, but gradually warms up and hits on all cylinders.\n",
      "The return of the Avengers crew, though bringing little new to the table after the 2012 series opener, Avengers Assemble, is an amiable enough hokum diversion for 2+ hours.\n",
      "Beyond the comic addition, 'Thor: Ragnarok' succeed in many other aspects; such as its agility regarding narrative. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "It goes above and beyond the expected MCU template...and sends a message of empowerment and progressivism that is desperately needed in today's culture.\n",
      "It's a blockbuster that manages to please with intelligence and fun. Whedon makes it look easy.\n",
      "It's damn fun to see Larson as a hero coming into her own, complete with 90s staples that includes a great soundtrack and references to Blockbuster, but it's hard to get truly invested since we know so little about Carol.\n",
      "Marvel movies are not adapted from stories they're based on, they seem to be the product of dreams. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "A slick, action-packed sequel for Marvel's God of Thunder.\n",
      "This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements.\n",
      "In a summer of indistinguishable franchise entries, this is one not to swat away.\n",
      "If you still get a kick out of seeing Spider-Man do his thing, this is a top-level effort on a par with Sam Raimi's much-loved Spider-Man 2.\n",
      "It wields an equally large cast with surprising dexterity, never losing sight of which players matter most to the story it's trying to tell.\n",
      "This feels like a really, really, expensive episode of Doctor Who. In a good way.\n",
      "Those in search of eye-popping, cliff-hanging spectacle won't be disappointed, but on a personal level (and post credits sequences aside) Joss Whedon this ain't.\n",
      "Cumberbatch wears that Strange cape well.\n",
      "Superhero movies aren't going anywhere, nor is their standard, on-to-the-next-fight structure, so it's heartening to see a gem that grandly and amusingly fills in the blanks.\n",
      "In comparison to other MCU films, the story is lacking, to be quite honest, but the cast's energy and rapport together kept me enjoying every minute of it all throughout.\n",
      "It's worth noting that while Ant-Man's listed first, this sequel is really all about the sting of the Wasp.\n",
      "Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms. I had a blast.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the comic book movie we had no idea could exist, until it lands in front of our eyes.\n",
      "Handsomely mounted and sufficiently majestic.\n",
      "This is a sequel that easily surpasses its predecessor by turning its previously dull hero into one with unexpected but logical depth.\n",
      "Captain America: The First Avenger neither commits any terrible storytelling offenses nor takes any significant creative risks. If the director and the script took more chances with the material, Marvel could have had their best movie ever.\n",
      "The film has a lot of solid laughs, actually, without becoming a cartoon.\n",
      "It's still a good Marvel movie (at times, a very good one), but it's a come down from the dizzying highs of the first installment. The laughs are still there, but they're less involuntary.\n",
      "It's this balance between real world stakes and superhero surrealism that makes Favreau's film such a success.\n",
      "The messaging doesn't need to be subtle to be important, and Captain Marvel wears its heart firmly on its sleeve.\n",
      "This feels like a critically important film, and a huge step forward in giving an African voice to mainstream cinema.\n",
      "A powerful, sweeping exploration of love, life, and the MCU's history, Eternals occasionally stumbles, but when it soars, this is Marvel Studios at its magnificent best.\n",
      "This isn't just a Marvel movie, but a historic mark in Black cinema.\n",
      "The Marvel blockbuster machine keeps on trucking with a double-sized new issue of Captain America that packs enough punch to distract from its grinding plot mechanics.\n",
      "As the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film helmed by a female superhero and the first co-directed by a woman, Captain Marvel has a lot to live up to.\n",
      "Directors Anthony and Joe Russo continue to mine their experience with TV comedies, juggling all the members of their superhero family with a playful touch that both informs character interaction and delivers vital breathing room in between battles.\n",
      "The first Marvel film in years that feels like a pure action-adventure movie\n",
      "Exciting, but the message is mixed: Stark's creation of Iron Man affirms rather than repudiates his arms race-exploiting past -- it proves once again that the one with the best weapons wins.\n",
      "Not everything about Black Panther works across the board but a huge amount of it does - and does so wonderfully.\n",
      "A lot of fun.\n",
      "What really blew me away was the women. Physically, mentally, spiritually, socially-it's the females in this film who truly conquer, while the men spend a lot of time grappling with each other in the mud.\n",
      "The Crocodile Dundee II of superhero films-in a good way!\n",
      "The grittiest Marvel movie yet.\n",
      "Guardians Of The Galaxy is at its best when it's trying to be funny. You could almost describe as a spoof in places!\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\n",
      "This is 2018's first great motion picture - a title that will surely be remembered when \"end of the year\" bests are discussed.\n",
      "Soars as an origin story with heart, cheeky humor, wit and warmth, zingy dialogue, punchy action, colorful characters and a hero--heroine--who breaks the glass ceiling on two worlds.\n",
      "... the movie is fun enough, and Waititi shows enough moxie and goofy wit throughout...\n",
      "An entertaining, engaging and impassioned movie that is both proud of and confident in its differences, and is also committed to shining the spotlight on the people that blockbuster cinema so often ignores.\n",
      "Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.\n",
      "But until all that nonsense gets rolling, Spider-Man: Far from Home is breezy and enjoyable, focusing on all that's most appealing about Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter ego Spider-Man.\n",
      "Endgame is hugely ambitious, ridiculous, over-the-top superhero filmmaking and I loved it.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp feeds into a longstanding trope about disability and doesn't even seem to realize it's doing it.\n",
      "Marvel's first Asian superhero led action-fest has exceptional storytelling, nuanced characters, spectacular choreography and special effects.\n",
      "Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.\n",
      "Tom Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry in Spider-Man: Far From Home, which features cutting edge CGI, fight scenes and a brilliant villain turn by Jake Gyllenhaal. Plus, no every super hero film needs Samuel L. Jackson. Best Summer Flick of 2019\n",
      "Rather than wiping out half of all life in the universe, this villain seeks to wipe out truth itself. And in 2019, there's nothing more terrifying, or more relevant, than that.\n",
      "Pops with the type of psychedelic, kaleidoscopic weirdness that'll have you wondering who dosed your popcorn with psilocybin... although it never fulfills the potential of its main character.\n",
      "If Captain Marvel is indicative of the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then the franchise is more vital and impressive than it has ever been.\n",
      "Favreau reassembles his main cast for another witty and exciting romp -- and adds the likes of Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson to increase our viewing pleasure.\n",
      "I left Ragnarok completely happy. But I also wanted more from Hela and especially from Valkyrie.\n",
      "It's so nice to see a Marvel film scripted and shot with some semblance of care, keeping some of the spectacle without sacrificing all of the substance.\n",
      "Tom Holland IS Peter Parker.\n",
      "If you like Black Widow, and you like Black Widow kicking ass, the movie delivers. But most fans will not watch it anywhere near as often as Endgame.\n",
      "While it's impossible to look at any Marvel product without considering how it fits into the larger puzzle, \"Captain Marvel,\" much like last year's \"Black Panther,\" deserves to stand on its own as much as it can.\n",
      "Captain Marvel does struggle to break out of the greater MCU. But what counts is that this is a story that manages to re-write the established canon of Marvel history that provides something fresh and new.\n",
      "Marvel films are all about anticipation: they're designed to make you crave the next helping before you've even swallowed the current one. But this is the first in a while that I've found myself immediately hungry to revisit.\n",
      "Marvel's The Avengers isn't the Second Coming, though it feels like it's been in the works almost as long as, but as far as big summer entertainment goes you'll rarely get much better.\n",
      "\"The First Avenger\" was a work of art, while \"The Winter Soldier\" is serviceable entertainment.\n",
      "The emotional stakes are raised in this exciting Marvel entry, which manages to balance all of its storylines remarkably well.\n",
      "Brimming with heart... up there in the upper echelon of MCU movies, and in Mysterio fans are given a fascinating character who ultimately has a key, key role in changing the landscape of this shared Marvel realm.\n",
      "There's just a little in this movie for everyone. And such scattershot fun is more than enough to tide us over until Captain American returns next year.\n",
      "Despite all the whiz-bang CGI effects, some more special than others, the moments I most appreciated in Endgame were the small-scale comic touches... Best of all is Robert Downey Jr.\n",
      "Taken on its own patchwork terms, Thor: Ragnarok is mostly diverting entertainment, though no match for what [Taika] Waititi can achieve on his own with a fraction of the budget.\n",
      "Far from Home loses a bit of its predecessor's real-world charm...Its characters, however, remain immensely likable...\n",
      "It's a near-miracle that six screenwriters were able to pool their talents and craft such a winsome, witty story.\n",
      "This could well be the least extended-preview-for-the-next-one MCU installment since Iron Man 3.\n",
      "It's outlandish, occasionally silly and surprisingly fun.\n",
      "The film works quite well. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "It's better and more emotionally resonant than the vast majority of superhero flicks, and even when Nick Fury is being portrayed as kind of a joke (weird choice, guys), Far from Home is an excellent sequel that will occasionally illicit ear-to-ear grins.\n",
      "Overall, I think that it's worth watching for sure.\n",
      "Marvel's Thor may be silly, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.\n",
      "When I saw that this was going to be a clash of superheroes, with former friends fighting each other, I wondered how they were going to set it up. Very carefully, it turns out, with a solid screenplay and strong performances.\n",
      "Infinity War may have proved that Marvel can pull off a massive superhero crossover event, but Endgame shows how much better these movies are when they pay attention to people, too.\n",
      "Sometimes, an MCU film, like Shang-Chi, is released that combines its louder, blockbuster values with a deeply human center, a magnificent, empathetic spark that reminds worn naysayers (admittedly like myself) what this unmatched series is capable of.\n",
      "Easily the funniest Marvel film to date, a huge achievement this far down the line and something that will have audiences crying tears of laughter.\n",
      "For now this film delivers the popcorn experience devotees have anxiously waited for. General audiences can also bask in the fun and glory.\n",
      "As entertaining as this movie is, it could have been even better.\n",
      "Captain Marvel is another winning entry into the MCU, with Larson emerging as a highly appealing kick-ass heroine with brains to match her brawn.\n",
      "The movie walks away from the formula that Marvel has given us for the last 15 years...and IT'S GOOD.[Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "A visual wonder... but you still feel the formula straining.\n",
      "Shero. Strong. Courageous. Powerful. You may be able to find flaws and nitpick at what you didn't like, but at the end of the day, Captain Marvel does its job.\n",
      "This leading-man humour is a large part of what makes Thor: Ragnarok just about the funniest superhero movie I have seen.\n",
      "As was the case with 2015's Ant-Man, it's nice to see a Marvel movie with a self-contained plotline.\n",
      "\"Captain America: Civil War\" is for every little kid who ever bashed one action figure into another while saying \"Pew! P-Pew! Kapow-shuh-WOOOOSH!!\" In other words, it's nearly perfect.\n",
      "Although there are some longeurs when Whedon feels bound to plot a pathway to Marvel's next tranche of potential blockbusters, the witty repartee between stars at ease in their superhero skin leavens the odd lull.\n",
      "Light and entertaining.\n",
      "This mega-entertaining \"Avengers\" film is something comic fans have dreamed of since Marvel debuted the title almost 50 years ago.\n",
      "Boden and Fleck leave room for quiet one-liners and sidelong glances - Mendelsohn is especially good at throwaway expressions, even in his space-lizard guise.\n",
      "Thor: Ragnarok feels like a Taika Waititi movie, and a very good one - in part because however briefly, it takes the god of thunder off the perpetual-motion machine of success.\n",
      "In some ways the best of the Marvel Comics preludes leading up to next year's superhero jamboree, The Avengers.\n",
      "...A wonderful, rousing payoff in the context of the big battle and as wildly inspiring imagery.\n",
      "Iron Man 2 is fun, unchallenging and inoffensive entertainment.\n",
      "The plot's the same old thing. Mad, mad, mad, mad science; imminent apocalypse; parent/child issues; blah blah blaggidy blah. The tone of Ant-Man, however, is relatively light and predominantly comic.\n",
      "It keeps things small-scale and low-key, and for the most part turns out better for it.\n",
      "The best attempt thus far at bringing Cap off the page and onto screens. Too bad it was hamstrung by 'setupforsequelitis.'\n",
      "It's not only heroes who can have superpowers, movies can have them too, and you can add \"Captain Marvel\" to the small list of those that do.\n",
      "Both the movie franchise and Tony Stark the alter ego are more self indulgent than putting your picture on a restaurant wall after downing a 5-lb. bacon cheese burger, then getting that burger named after you. And naming it Awesome.\n",
      "Although its origin-story machinations get the better of it, Ant-Man isn't a bust.\n",
      "The costumed antics of Homecoming are a joy to watch, with tense set pieces and well-choreographed action, but some of the movie's brightest spots are in its more down-to-earth moments.\n",
      "Does \"Black Panther\" occasionally fall into predictable superhero traps? Yes. But it also feels like the work of a filmmaker with a specific vision, one he more or less executes.\n",
      "[The Avengers] is fast-paced, funny, thrilling and well-crafted.\n",
      "Really, \"woo-hoo!\" just about covers it.\n",
      "Avengers: Endgame is mostly adequate, if overlong, but if it had spent a little more time on imagination over spectacle, it might have had a chance of being the kind of overwhelming cinematic epoch that it is clearly aiming to be.\n",
      "It is a bold undertaking, to readjust what is expected of the MCU/Avengers formula, and there are moments when the sheer scale and momentum match the narrative ambition\n",
      "And so was born Iron Man 3, featuring the further exploits of the only superhero who is not dishwasher-safe.\n",
      "It knocks down a lot of the infrastructure the previous films had created, and it does so in a way that feels organic and refreshing for the Marvel world at large.\n",
      "\"Great story, great performances, great intrigue. Some may have done well in one of those areas, but Far From Home excels in all.\"\n",
      "The laid back freewheeling groove disguising a remarkably smooth and accomplished ride. The design and sense of scale are dazzling sophisticated.\n",
      "Part George Lucas and part Chuck Jones, Guardians of the Galaxy has enough scrappy heart and smart humor to make it seem like the best possible kind of product, one where the talent of all involved makes it easy to enjoy their hustle.\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is an eager puppy of a $100 million superhero tentpole, and it knows precisely where on your face to lick you.\n",
      "That isn't to say I didn't enjoy myself. I just didn't feel Marvel trying to do anything different this time around.\n",
      "I found the film lots of fun to watch, but by the end, the special effects -- amazing as they are -- took over and had a numbing effect.\n",
      "Far and away the best movie about the God of Thunder and the funniest comedy of the year not involving Stalin, the third Thor movie benefits greatly from having Taika Waititi at the helm.\n",
      "Black Widow has so much potential! We hope they seize on it within the next 6 years! *a tumbleweed blows by*\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp delivers what it promises. Maybe a little more. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Homecoming is a friendly reminder that even the most spectacular heroes have a lot of growing up to do.\n",
      "Given that the plot motor is Thanos's worry that the universe is overpopulated, sly self-awareness is shown as the filmmakers embrace drastic solutions to the problems of braiding multiple franchises into one.\n",
      "In the matter of \"Dr. Strange,\" two words: Big. Fun.\n",
      "Spider-Man: Far From Home is about exactly that, the idea that everyone needs a breather after big stuff happens, but the real world is always there waiting for you.\n",
      "Taika Waititi brings to the Thor table is an ability to match laughs with some genuine heart. The film is different, it is weird, there is a lot going on, but there is also a galactic portion of fun. This could be Marvel's first cult classic.\n",
      "The film is very prog. But also very pop.\n",
      "A good-humored, unapologetically patriotic take-off on a gung-ho World War II war movie, Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger may be the best superhero movie of the year.\n",
      "Fresh, fun and fantastic.\n",
      "A ridiculous, overacted, confusing and too talky but audience friendly comic book thriller from Marvel Comics.\n",
      "Whedon pulls off a stunning feat in bringing balance to this superhuman circus, engineered to charm the geek core and non-fans alike.\n",
      "The Incredible Hulk is often loud, and it can be quite dumb, but it's certainly not bloated.\n",
      "Joe and Anthony Russo (who directed the earlier Captain America: Winter Soldier, which introduced even more story threads picked up in this film's dense plot weave) are actually quite adept at this kind of big team juggling.\n",
      "Yes, sometimes there's a bit too much story at the expense of the action. But when was the last time you had that complaint about a big event movie?\n",
      "In a cinematic world crowded with comic-book flicks, \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" stands out. And that's no small accomplishment.\n",
      "It's a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.\n",
      "What is surprising about Infinity War when you watch it a second time on VOD is how much of the film endures because of the character development across the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "It's featherweight fun that won't change your life, but that's perfectly OK.\n",
      "Yet it's The Walking Dead's Gurira who steals the show as the ferocious Okoye, gloriously swinging her spear in a billowing red gown.\n",
      "Nothing ruins a good movie more than calling it a great one, and while Guardians of the Galaxy is good, no one will mistake it for a high point in the MCU.\n",
      "There is a healthy dose of cheese in this slightly campy superhero flick and it does well not to take itself too seriously.\n",
      "Ant-Man is fun but surprisingly conventional.\n",
      "Despite deplorable 3D that mutes the colors and an ill-advised ending, this is a very entertaining film.\n",
      "The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movie's very elegant fluidity rests ...\n",
      "Florence Pugh and Scarlet Johansson's relationship is the heart of the story. David Harbour is thoroughly enjoyable. While not a perfect film, it's a bittersweet feeling watching Scarlett's run as Natasha Romanoff coming to a final end in the MCU.\n",
      "It makes an ageless space god with the nobility of King Arthur and the bodacious abs of a supermodel look like an underdog. Fallibility, not lightning, is his secret weapon.\n",
      "The Marvel Fatigue factor continues, to be sure. But hiring Waititi, and letting the right actors lean into the comedy, constitutes not a marvel, but a qualified victory.\n",
      "However, [Captain Marvel's] best quality lies in how the film seeks to emulate the way comics managed to comment on the current social and cultural landscape. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Some will immediately sniff out \"Black Widow\" for the glorified side mission, meant to set up an inevitable Disney+ series, that it is but \"Black Widow\" manages to get the job done, giving the beloved Natasha Romanoff the spotlight she always deserved.\n",
      "Cheeky, good-natured, clever and even a little on the subversive side, Ant-Man is that rarest of comic-book movies -- one that manages to be personal and doesn't take itself too seriously.\n",
      "The emotions are high, everything has weight, and the action and laughs are nonstop.\n",
      "Does it work? Of course. Marvel hasn't truly missed in a long time.\n",
      "Downey whips out the big guns, sexy banter in fun sequel.\n",
      "It's a magnificent action film, it's a wonderful character piece, it's big, brash, bursting with confidence and brio; it's Marvel firing on all cylinders just when, by rights, we might be expecting the law of diminishing returns to set in.\n",
      "Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them all the way through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them.\n",
      "Audaciously epic and stirringly entertaining, it's a devastating, historic spectacle (emphasis on devastating).\n",
      "A fun '90s-set adventure that delivers action, emotion and humour in the mighty Marvel manner.\n",
      "\"Captain America\" is a grittier, more dangerous and darker movie than you've come to expect from the features in the Marvel franchise.\n",
      "Marvel does not disappoint its fans. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "Guardians of The Galaxy (...) was a unique outlier compared to its homogenized brethren. While Vol. 2 is just as charming, if not more so, it still suffers from many of the same issues that have plagued every Marvel film.\n",
      "Director Jon Watts nicely handles the scenes of adolescent banter and awkwardness; if anything, they're more engaging than the action sequences.\n",
      "Like the best films of this genre, much of the massive budget clearly ended up on the screen and thus diehard fans and even casual moviegoers will certainly get their money's worth. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)\n",
      "Tempering its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and just a little dose of dramatics, Thor is a super-charged fantasy epic that can stand alone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Overall the inaugural take of Danvers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a fun, entertaining ride that we are definitely rooting for more as we go further into a new phase following Endgame.\n",
      "Good news everyone! That Hulk dick joke we ordered has arrived!\n",
      "A light and airy popcorn movie full of all those watermarks Hulk fans clamor after.\n",
      "If you're looking for a popcorn lobotomy, and I mean that in a good way, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is the space comedy for you.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a refreshing superhero movie. It takes the spotlight and aims it squarely at its characters.\n",
      "For a film that never stops flirting with silliness, it's impressive how likable and down-to-earth Thor proves to be.\n",
      "Performances blossom and surprise, their chemistry buoying the familial longing required of every superhero backstory while anchoring action in characters you can care about.\n"
