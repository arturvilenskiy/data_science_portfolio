       "  'It was the right choice to leave this film set in the 1940s during World War II. Not only was it good for this film, but it\\'s a great setup for \"The Avengers.\"',\n",
       "  'A good, old-fashioned American story.',\n",
       "  \"The best attempt thus far at bringing Cap off the page and onto screens. Too bad it was hamstrung by 'setupforsequelitis.'\",\n",

       "  \"For the teenage fantasy crowd needing a new hero. But even if it feels like air conditioning in the Arctic, it's plenty entertaining.\",\n",
       "  'Rooted in reality and without the superhero tights, an impressive 3D success. The CGI transformation of Steve Rogers is fantastic. I worry that Stan Lee, through his Hickcock cameos, will appear in perpetuity in all Marvel movies.',\n",
       "  \"After a decade of Dark Knights and doom and gloom predominating the spandex set, it's a relief to see a noble, essentially uncomplicated funny book character, even if the good captain is square as a brick.\",\n",
       "  \"It had more heart than 'Iron Man.'\",\n",
       "  'No clever messages here, just bang-on romance and action, with another fresh twist on 20th-century history woven in for the kids to dive into after the credits have rolled.',\n",
       "  \"Even moviegoers suffering from superhero burnout might want to stand up and salute Captain America, which doesn't match the excellence of X-Men: First-Class but ranks ahead of fellow summer stablemates Thor and Green Lantern.\",\n",
       "  \"Where are the iconic moments in these movies; the classic lines, the signature set pieces, the golden cues? Brand awareness is high but surely that wasn't the limit of the new studio's ambition?\",\n",
       "  \"It doesn't try too hard for irony or style; the comic-book sensibility remains pure, square, and happily stupid.\",\n",

       "  \"This one is okay, but I'm a little burnt out on the whole superhero thing.\",\n",

       "  \"He's got the buff body, noble intentions and cool costume, but not much more. Captain America makes for a better propaganda symbol than superhero.\",\n",
       "  'Capitão América é apenas uma promessa de filme - e caberá a Os Vingadores fazer jus a esta promessa.',\n",
       "  \"Joe Johnston delivers the squarest Marvel adaptation of the current cycle, and it's the film's pulp sense of adventure and the characters' old-fashioned decorum that make it so satisfying.\",\n",
       "  'Traditional Second World War thrillers meet the superhero era head on in Captain America - and the result is the first must-see blockbuster of the summer.',\n",
       "  'about as good as we could expect it to be, if not more so given that its hero is certainly one of the blandest and least psychologically complex in the Marvel universe',\n",
       "  \"It's not as cool as Iron Man, doesn't have the brains of The Dark Knight or the looks of Thor, but it's got enough Ka-pow! to make you relish the inevitable sequel. Job done.\",\n",
       "  'Evans is unprecedentedly touching and engaging for a superhero - and the rest of the cast help this adventure seem something close to character-driven instead of just being a bundle of stunts.',\n",
       "  \"These characters aren't just stick figures to fill in the time between the next set-piece; they talk, and argue, and appear to inhabit actual personalities.\",\n",
       "  \"Far fleeter than most of its current comic-book-movie rivals, Captain America has some of the same rollicking Saturday-matinee spirit as Raiders of the Lost Ark, even if it can't match the earlier film's pace and panache.\",\n",

       "  'No one is going to pretend that this is art, psychologically profound or anything other than preposterous. It is a popcorn movie, but much better than most of its kind.',\n",

       "  \"It ain't trailblazing, but it's solidly enjoyable.\",\n",

       "  'War movie clichés, gung ho derring-do and seamless special effects all fit together well in a pleasingly retro environment that boasts enough sci-fi paraphernalia to put an end to the argument that it may be too old-fashioned.',\n",
       "  \"While it's not the greatest superhero movie ever made, Captain America fittingly sets the stage for 2012's megamovie and - more importantly - nicely side-steps its potential pitfalls.\",\n",
       "  \"Joe Johnston's adaptation of the Marvel comic book exalts the virtues of optimism, decency, and perseverance in a rousing adventure of old-fashioned adolescent exuberance.\",\n",
       "  \"At least Captain America has a stab at being an independent, original creation before it falls back on the same old go-to's with their same old eye patches.\",\n",
       "  'Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers with the appropriate amount of earnestness and the art direction and costume design sell the 1940s as seen through a comic-book lens.',\n",
       "  \"The effects work...integrates flawlessly with the rich, muted retro-themed colour palette of cinematographer Shelly Johnson, one of the few lensers able to work the darkening effect of the 3D process to the film's advantage.\",\n",
       "  'As superhero flicks go, the first half of Captain America -- the one that counts -- is well above average. But the real superheroics here belong to the F/X team.',\n",
       "  \"It's for anyone who can respond to the thrill of a big, bold adventure movie with a sense of fun.\",\n",
       "  \"The film does have its thrilling moments and iconic images, but, as directed by Joe Johnston, it's very much a storybook film.\",\n",
       "  \"Captain America paints a simple tale of goodies versus baddies with none of the depth, humor or class of Marvel's earlier X-Men summer offering.\",\n",
       "  'Johnston should be saluted for old-fashioned heart in a cynical age, while Marvel should be confined to barracks for cynical marketing.',\n",
       "  'Pure, unashamed, adrenaline-fuelled joy, with a revelatory lead turn that should nudge Chris Evans towards being a top-tier action hero.',\n",
       "  'Pacy and punchy, but not quite a knockout.',\n",
       "  \"None of it, however, would work without Evans' easy charm. His appeal is different to his Marvel stable mates; he is modest, kind and, ahem, a virgin (this is certainly not the persona Evans has given off in other films).\",\n",
       "  'For starters, a comic book story set during World War Two offers a perfect opportunity to banish irony, make use of Nazis as bad guys, and cheer on an all-American hero. Chris Evans is well cast in the leading role, as he not only embodies the physical...',\n",
       "  'The best superhero movie of the summer - good acting, good special effects, good storyline, and a heaping dollop of patriotism.',\n",
