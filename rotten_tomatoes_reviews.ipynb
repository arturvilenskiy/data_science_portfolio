    "For this project, I have decided to create a NLP model that would be able to differentiate between good and bad movie reviews. \n",

    "The reason behind this project was me watching a latest Marvel movie, which I have enjoyed, only to realise that it has pretty bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. So I have decided to get all the critics' reviews from 26 movies that are considered part of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU). An important note is that Rotten Tomatoes publishes only the summary rather than a full review. \n",

    "So this project consists of 3 major parts:\n",

    "1. Scraping Rotten Tomatoes to download all reviews for each of the 26 movies.\n",

    "2. Quick Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating Bag of Words model. \n",

    "4. Choosing the best classification model + hypertuning the parameters to (hopefully!) improve the performance."
